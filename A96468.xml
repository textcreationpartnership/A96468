         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>FRIENDLY READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE Can aſſure thee, it is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our inclinations to concern our ſelves in matters of Controverſie, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Print: But the defence of Truth, the Vindication of our abuſed Principles and Friends in general, with our Abſent Friend in particular, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prevail'd upon us, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the following Rejoynder, in Anſwer to a Book wrote in this City, Entituled: <hi>A Brief and Modeſt Reply to Mr.</hi> Penn's <hi>Tedious, Scurrilous and Unchriſtian Defence againſt the Bp. of</hi> Cork, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which Book, tho the Authour has not Subſcribed his Name, yet we conceive him to be <hi>Edward Wettenhall</hi> Late Bp. of <hi>Cork. (1ſt.)</hi> Becauſe we are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed he ordered the Printing, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame to be Publiſhed. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> It is not only called and allowed by all to be his, (ſo far as we have heard) but confirmed ſo to be, in Crying about the ſtreets of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Cork. (3ly.)</hi> The Book it ſelf puts it out of Queſtion to be his, or don by a perſon to whom he dictated, which is obſervable
<pb facs="tcp:173010:3"/> throughout the ſame, and ſo particularly to be noted, in the very Introduction. Likewiſe in <hi>(p.</hi> 3.) ſpeaks of a Book of <hi>W. P's.</hi> then before him: Theſe Reaſons having induced us to conclude him the Authour, we have therefore in our following Diſcourſe Styled him ſo.</p>
            <p>We obſerve the Bp. in the Title of his Book Applies, <hi>Brevity and Modeſty</hi> to his own account, but the blackning Epithets, of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, Scurrillity, and Unchriſtianity</hi> to <hi>W. P</hi>'s. To which we Anſwer, <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> That the Bp's. Reply is brief we grant (as we have obſerved) and ſo Brief too, that we (ſhall not determin, but) leave it to the Reader to judge, whether it deſerves the Name of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. But if ſtyling his Reply Brief, and <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> Tedious, will plead Excuſe for its being ſo ſhort of an Anſwer, we allow the Bp. has made an advantage thereby. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> As to its Modeſty, we will here give a few of the many Inſtances we could bring, and let the Reader judg, If charging the Quakers, with <hi>Sleight, Cunning, Craftineſs, Lying in Wait to deceive,</hi> (a Character for the worſt of men,) as in <hi>(p. 1ſt)</hi> If Calling the Teſtimony of our Friends, to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Men, according to Holy Scriptures, <hi>The Poiſonous Pill of their Light within,</hi> (Page 13.) Making <hi>W. P.</hi> a <hi>Diffuſer of Poiſon,</hi> (Page 18.) Charging the Quakers, (moſt uncharitably) with being <hi>ſo intent upon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:173010:3"/> 
               <hi>minding worldly gain both Day and Night, as to paſs moſt Days in the Week without a Prayer to God, either in Publick Aſſembly or Family, (page</hi> 21.) Suggeſting that <hi>W. P.</hi> is <hi>Popiſhly Affected, or has a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Atheiſm,</hi> becauſe he is for a Free Goſpel Miniſtry, and pleads againſt a Compelled or Forced Maintenance for them, <hi>(Page</hi> 25.) If theſe Expreſſions, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance more of the ſame kind, through his Reply, (too tedious to Mention here,) be either Modeſt upon <hi>W. P.</hi> in particular, or the Quakers in general, we are to learn what Modeſty means. And if the Bp. (upon ſecond conſideration, ſhall ſtill) think them ſo, we may take leave to tell him, we are no more obliged to him for his Modeſty, then to his Charity, <hi>(3ly.)</hi> As to <hi>W. P's.</hi> being Scurrilous and Unchriſtian in his Defence; we ſay, If bare charges were to paſs for Proofs, he might be thought guilty of both; but if demonſtration be required for Proofs, as well as charges, we appeal to the Reader, and let him be judg, whether they will not rather fall upon the Bp. while we believe, he will find no ſuch ſcurrilous and Unchriſtian Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> as are in the Bp's. <hi>Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We alſo obſerve, That altho the Bp's. <hi>Reply</hi> is Dated, <hi>Cork, March,</hi> 21. 1698/9. at which time, he was not removed hence, Yet we have
<pb facs="tcp:173010:4"/> no reaſon aſſigned wherefore it was not Printed, or made Publick till <hi>October,</hi> 1699. What Reaſons, the Bp. had for delaying its Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he beſt knows: But this we know, that <hi>W. P.</hi> ſailed for <hi>Penſilvania</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> and ſoon after out came the Bp's. <hi>Reply.</hi> Had <hi>W. P.</hi> continued in <hi>England</hi> the delay had been no blame upon the Bp. but ſince the Bp. had made ſeveral perſonal Reflections and Charges againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> which none could Anſwer, ſo well as himſelf, we think he ought to have Publiſhed his Reply, before <hi>W. P's.</hi> departure for <hi>America,</hi> (ſince he had time enough for ſo doing) That ſo <hi>W. P.</hi> might have appeared in his own Vindication, and which he could eaſily have done, had the <hi>Bp's, Reply,</hi> come out in due time: But ſince the Bp. thought not fit ſo to do, whereby this <hi>Rejoynder</hi> hath fallen into the Hands of Perſons, leſs skilful in the Defence of Truth then <hi>W. P.</hi> (as we freely confeſs it hath,) and not ſo qualified to Treat the Bp. as <hi>W. P.</hi> nor perhaps, as the Bp. himſelf might expect. The Bp. may be pleaſed, or diſpleaſed with himſelf, as he finds occaſion, for depriving <hi>W. P.</hi> of that ſervice, and thereby (to be ſure) himſelf of an Abler Opponent. But tho the Bp. ſhould diſlike us for Opponents, yet we think he cannot (at leaſt ought not) to blame us, (ſince Reaſon and Juſtice allows us the Priviledge) to appear in our Juſt Vindication, when we find our Principles, as well as our
<pb facs="tcp:173010:4"/> Friends, ſo greatly Abuſed, Miſrepreſented, and Reflected upon, as we believe will plainly appear (to the Impartial Reader,) they are in the Bp's. <hi>Reply:</hi> However, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Treatment, tho we may be plain, where the Nature of his Charges extorts it from us, yet we hope the Reader will find, that we have not only endeavoured to carry our ſelves, with that Moderation towards him, which becomes us both as Men and Chriſtians too: But like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as fair Opponents, having deſignedly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perverted his Words, nor Miſrepreſented his Sence, ſo far as we underſtood them; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have thus done on our Parts, or the Bp. hath done the contrarry by <hi>W. P.</hi> is left to the Impartial Reader.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, The following <hi>Rejoynder</hi> was Writ laſt Winter, according to its Date at the End, and as a Reaſon for its lying ſo long Unprinted, the Reader may pleaſe to underſtand, That being adviſed by a Friend from <hi>Dublin,</hi> above Eight Months paſt, he had ſent One of the Bp's. <hi>Reply's,</hi> by way of <hi>Mary-Land</hi> to <hi>W. P.</hi> it gave us ſome hopes of an Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, from himſelf, which we greatly deſired. But inaſmuch, as ſome Letters, hath been very lately received from <hi>W. P.</hi> and that he makes no mention of that <hi>Reply,</hi> we now conclude it has Miſcarried; Therefore to the end we may no longer remain Silent, under the Bp's. Charges and Reflections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have thought fit at
<pb facs="tcp:173010:5"/> laſt, (tho late,) to make this Publick, and the rather becauſe we have heard, ſome have conceived an Opinion, That the Bp's. <hi>Reply</hi> was Unanſwerable.</p>

            <p>THE Biſhop ſeems pleaſed with <hi>William Penn</hi> for Printing <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> before his own Defence, and begins his Introduction thus, (P. 1) <hi>The Bp. of</hi> Cork <hi>being to vindicate the Truth and Himſelf, thanks</hi> Mr. P. <hi>for having Printed both his own Paper and the Bp's. Teſtimony againſt it at length before his Book; for the Bp. believes that all ſober and Reaſonable Chriſtians who ſhall read thoſe two over and conſider them, will eaſily acquit the Bp. from the firſt of</hi> Mr. P's. <hi>Imputations in his Preface, that he is a man of a mind dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe, who would have ſtrife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians abated, and for diſcouraging Controverſies in Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Evident then it is, <hi>W. P.</hi> was careful to ſet the whole matter fairly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Reader, that ſo he might be able to make the better Judgment, and we wiſh the Bp. had as well deſerved thanks from <hi>W. P.</hi> for ſetting down the Defence (tho' not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173010:6"/> at length yet) in its due ſtrength, without ſuppreſſing ſo conſiderable a part of it and perverting ſo much of the reſt, as will be found he hath done. Next we are equally agreed to refer <hi>W. P's.</hi> Imputation to all ſober and reaſonable Chriſtians, believing they will not ſo eaſily acquit the Bp. as he thinks, conſidering he was the only Perſon in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who broke out into a Publick Teſtimony againſt that Inoffenſive Paper called <hi>Goſpell Truths,</hi> and therein greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed us, as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath plainly ſhewn in many Inſtances from Page 22 to 26 of his Defence, but ſlipt over by the Bp. with ſaying, <hi>To Omit things leſs Material;</hi> as if ſo egregiouſly to abuſe and villifie a People, as he is there charged by <hi>W. P.</hi> to have done, were a light matter with him. And farther to ſpeak our Sentiments (after the Bp's. way) Let <hi>W. P's.</hi> Defence and the Bp's. Reply be read over and conſidered by all Sober and Impartial Chriſtians, and we cannot but believe they will be of our mind, for the ſakes of ſuch only there was no need of this Rejoynder; that Defence being (as we think) a ſufficient Anſwer of it ſelf to the moſt material parts of the Bp's. Reply.</p>
            <p>The Bp. proceeds thus. (ibid 1) <hi>the Bp. ſays a peaceable Teſtimony againſt the ſlight of men, touching whom it is queſtionable, whether they be Chriſtians or not, and againſt</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:173010:6"/> 
               <hi>their cunning craftineſs who lye in wait to deceive, is no moving ſtrife or raiſing quarrels among Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to the peaceableneſs of the Bp's. Teſtimony his management therein, doth evidently ſhew it, and which we leave to the Impartial Reader: But if Miſrepreſenting, Abuſing, and Calling us no Chriſtians; if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding Principles upon us as ours which we utterly diſown and abhor; if drawing Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from our Words &amp; Writings, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of, much leſs intended, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them upon us, tho we diſclaim them; if curtailing our Writings, leaving out what explained our meaning, and wilfuly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking our plain Senſe, with much more too tedious to mention, would make it queſtionable, whether we are Chriſtians or not, the Bp. is in the right: Nay we will go farther with him; it would not only be queſtionable, but we had without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture been poſitively made no Chriſtians; for it hath been the conſtant practice of our Adverſaries (ſince we were a People) thus to deal by us, and amongſt the reſt, we cannot excuſe the Bp. from having a ſhare in ſome of theſe things, which ſhall be ſhewn in their places. But bleſſed be God, 'tis not the Tongues or Pens of all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries in the World, can make us no Chriſtians; for we have not only believed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173010:7"/> in the outward coming and appearance of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Fleſh with his Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection, Aſſention and Mediation, but in humility of Soul and to the praiſe of his Holy Name, we can ſay we have witneſſed his ſecond coming in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, according to his promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 14. 17, 81. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 26. and 16. 13. to fit and prepare our Souls in order to obtain the benefit of his outward death and ſufferings for us. And thus we are not only Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by Notion and Tradition but ſuch in reallity, for which we have the evidence in our ſelves according to 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witneſs in himſelf. And</hi> Rom. 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God.</hi> Here then is the double and agreeing record of true Religion, the Illumination of the holy Ghoſt within, agreeing with the Teſtimony of the Scriptures of Truth without, which we ſhall have farther occaſion to ſpeak to. But here, that we may not be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, we do not mean ſo largely of all ſuch as ſome may call Quakers, but of ſuch whoſe Lives and Converſations influenced by the Holy Spirit beſpeak them to be true Quakers and therefore true Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Next as to the Bp's. groſs, (and to uſe his own Words) <hi>ſcurrilous and unchriſtian</hi> charge
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173010:7"/> of <hi>ſlight, cuning, craftinneſs, lying in wait to deceive,</hi> which is brought as a confirming charge to his Teſtmony, in which he told us and tells again <hi>(P.</hi> 9) he did not judge us: We ſay as to this charge, we ſhall not at preſent ſay much, (reſerving it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with more of the ſame kind) only tell the Bp. That as we know not how he will reconcile this to modeſty, ſo we hope he will not ſay again, he don't judge us, while if what he ſays were true (whether it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our Principles or our Morals) we think 'tis plain he equally judges us to be the worſt and baſeſt of Men; the Bp. Proceeds, (P. 1.) <hi>Mr.</hi> P. <hi>adds he gave his Paper to the Bp. in a private way, at a friendly viſit upon his own deſire. This is what the Bp. Called writing in ſuch a way that is hard to know what is meant. If Mr.</hi> P. <hi>means that either he gave the Paper to the Bp. upon the Bp's. Deſire, or made that Viſit upon the Bp's. Deſire, in both Senſes the ſaying is utterly falſe, for both the Viſit and the Paper were a Surprize, and altogether unexpected by the Bp. Thus the Bp. (P.</hi> 1 <hi>and</hi> 2) <hi>Anſw. 1ſt.</hi> As to the Paper, take the words as they lye in <hi>W. P's.</hi> Preface <hi>(P.</hi> 1) which runs thus <q>(Given him by me in a Private way at a Friendly Viſit upon his own deſire.)</q> Conſidering the Order of the words, we believe any Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reader will conclude the Bp's. deſire was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173010:8"/> relative to the Viſit, not the Paper; but waving that, ſee but about ten lines farther and the matter will be paſt doubt, where <hi>W. P.</hi> Speaks thus, <q>I did Indeed, perceiving him converſant in our Writings, &amp; his Character moderation, caſually preſent him with one of theſe Papers.</q> Again, at the end of the Preface <hi>W. P.</hi> ſpeaking of the Paper ſays <hi>given him.</hi> Now Reader judg in the matter, Can any thing be plainer, then that the Paper was <hi>W. P's.</hi> Preſent, and not given at the Bp's. Deſire. From whence we conclude, that either the Bp's. over eager deſire for an advantage againſt the Quakers, made him fall into this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, or he thought it might paſs with his unwary Reader, as a Confirmation of his former Charge, about the Quakers way of Writing. But now ſince the Bp. is ſo Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical about Words, may not we with more reaſon and juſtice return the Charge upon himſelf, where he ſays, <hi>This is what the Bp. called Writing in ſuch a way that is hard to know what is meant.</hi> Whereas what the Bp. ſaid in his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> before, runs thus, <hi>You have ſuch a way of Writing and Speaking that it is very hard, in many matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to know what you mean;</hi> So that 'twas matters of Religion he then ſpoke of; but that which he now applies, this way of Writing and Speaking to, is not matter of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173010:8"/> Religion, but a meer circumſtance of <hi>W. P's.</hi> viſiting the Bp. upon the Bp's. Deſire, or not; ſo to put the beſt conſtruction upon this miſtake, the Bp. forgot himſelf when he ſaid, <hi>This is what the Bp. called Writing in ſuch a way, &amp;c.</hi> But (2dly) Suppoſing we ſhould let it go, as the Bp. would have it, he will ſtill be in no better a caſe, for the word [this,] the Bp. makes to intend <hi>W. P's.</hi> Words in his Defence relating to the Paper and Viſit, and thoſe words [what] and [called] reſpect the time paſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to what the Bp. has charged the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers withal in his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> about their way of Writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How then, ſay we could any Words in the Bp's. <hi>Teſtimony</hi> be relative to <hi>W. P's.</hi> Defence, which was writ afterwards, and was an Anſwer to that <hi>Yeſtimony.</hi> Thus, Reader, ſee how the Bp. falls into the ſame fault, he would have charged upon <hi>W. P.</hi> and the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. We had not thus troubled thee, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, about Words, but the Bp. gave the occaſion, and we were willing to let thee ſee, how ready the Bp. is (amongſt the reſt of our Adverſaries) to charge and condemn us without ground, while the fault is in themſelves, and yet this is little to what will appear hereafter in the Bp. Next as to the Viſit, the Bp. denies he deſired it, and charges <hi>W. P.</hi> with an utter falſhood;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173010:9"/> but he would have done well to have Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited this, with others of his Perſonal Charges and Reflections, before <hi>W. P.</hi> went for <hi>America,</hi> that ſo he might have Anſwered for himſelf; However, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, we can in this Caſe, ſay ſomething in the defence of <hi>W. P.</hi> and muſt ſay, we believe the Bp. to be forgetful; for <hi>Amos Strettell</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> being at <hi>Cork</hi> while <hi>W. P.</hi> was here, and hapning to be in company with him and <hi>Joſeph Pike,</hi> at the Houſe of the ſaid <hi>Pike,</hi> at a time, when <hi>G. R.</hi> came to viſit <hi>W. P.</hi> they the ſaid <hi>Strettell</hi> and <hi>Pike,</hi> heard <hi>G. R.</hi> ſay to <hi>W. P.</hi> That the Bp. had a great deſire to ſee him, and deſired him to bring him to his Houſe, to which <hi>W. P.</hi> agreed, when a convenient ſeaſon offered. Thus much the ſaid <hi>Strettell</hi> and <hi>Pike</hi> remembers, and are ready to give under their Hands, if deſired; and 'tis believed <hi>G. R.</hi> himſelf cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, whom we know, and is known to be a Perſon of that Character and Station, in the World, that would ſcorn to forge ſuch a Story to <hi>W. P.</hi> However it accidentally hapned <hi>G. R.</hi> did not accompany him, as deſigned, in that Viſit occaſioned by <hi>W. P's.</hi> dining at a Houſe, which lay not far from the Bp's. He thence took the oportunity of Viſiting the Bp. in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with two other Perſons. We find
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173010:9"/> the Bp. confeſſeth, <hi>He had a little Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which might paſs for a Deſire,</hi> to ſee <hi>W. P.</hi> (whom he jeeringly calls <hi>King of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania)</hi> as he would have been deſirous to ſee the <hi>Pope, or the Great Turk, or any other great Man of Sin;</hi> This we find he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and we may be ſo Charitable as to believe he forgot the other. To conclude this point about the Viſit: If the Bp. hath conceived any diſlike againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> for puting it in Print, either becauſe it might be a Scandal to the Bp. in regard, <hi>W. P.</hi> is a Quaker, or that he thought <hi>W. P.</hi> might thereby raiſe his Credit with the World, (which the Bp. would have depreſſed) we ſay if either of theſe be the Caſe, we believe he may be very eaſie in the matter; for without leſſening to the Bp. he may know many Perſons of much greater note and ſtation in the World then he <hi>(Ireland</hi> not excepted) have deſired to ſee and converſe with <hi>W. P.</hi> which as we don't believe he valued himſelf upon, leſs reaſon then had he to value himſelf upon the Bp's. deſire, and no other reaſon can we ſuppoſe <hi>W. P.</hi> had for Printing it, then to demonſtrate how unſuitable a return and courſe treatment the Bp. gave him for his friendly Viſit. As to the Bp's. ſuſpition of a deſign in <hi>W. P's.</hi> giving him the Paper, as he tells us (tho' he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173010:10"/> leaves us in the dark as to what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign could be.) We Anſwer, 'Twas need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thus to tell us now, ſince <hi>W. P.</hi> has told the deſign in his Preface (which was to improve the Bp's. Temper in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) which the Bp. ſhould have diſproved, or told us what other deſign <hi>W. P.</hi> could have in preſenting him with the Paper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Ibid.</hi> 2) As to the Bp's. Jeers upon <hi>W. P.</hi> Calling him <hi>King of Penſilvania,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him with a <hi>Spirit of Diſcerning,</hi> and ſlily Inſinuating him among the number of <hi>Great Men of Sin,</hi> we ſhall ſay the leſs here, in regard we ſhall take notice thereof in another place; And as to his Margin Note, given him upon Information, that <hi>W. P.</hi> ſhould ſay he had <hi>a Kingdom of his own, which was underſtod of Penſilvania.</hi> What if the Bp's. Informer miſunderſtood <hi>W. P;</hi> nay, what if the whole Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was falſe, let the Reader judg whether it became the gravity of a Perſon, in the Bp's. ſtation thus to jeer upon Information. <hi>(Ibid.</hi> 2) Says the Bp. <hi>And thus much as to Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But before we end we muſt take notice of the Bp's. ſhortneſs (not to ſay unfairneſs) in not taking notice or anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what followed in the Preface, which lies thus; <q>Nor was it writ (namely <hi>Goſpel
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173010:10"/> Truths)</hi> for an exact and compleat account of our Belief; but occaſionaly to prevent the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, that the attempts of a courſe and ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Pen at <hi>Dublin</hi> juſt before might provoke in ſome againſt us. As to the points touched upon in the <hi>Goſpel Truths.</hi>
               </q> Thus <hi>W. P.</hi> Now Reader, we do not blame the Bp. barely for taking no notice of this part, but we think it became him, either to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved what <hi>W. P.</hi> here ſaid, or not continued his Reflections now in his <hi>Reply,</hi> for the brevity of that Paper, while he had not only the above notice, but had alſo <hi>Robert Barclay's Apology,</hi> and the <hi>Riſe and Progreſs of the People called Quakers,</hi> which fully and clearly vindicates at large ſome of thoſe Tenets, he (now again) cenſures as ſhort expreſt in that Paper, as we ſhall ſhew in their places. But the Bp. proceeds thus,</p>
            <p>(Ibid. 2) <hi>The firſt charge in his Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Bp. is, that he did not prove ſuch a Reader as he profeſt himſelf, Mr.</hi> P. <hi>would have had him ſuch a Reader that had rather they ſhould be in the right then in the wrong; the Bp. never profeſt himſelf ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> How will the Bp. be able to Reconcile this, to the Words, in his <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> where he ſays in the begining of it, <hi>Friends, I am ſuch a Reader as in your Paper you deſire.</hi> This in Anſwer to <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:173010:11"/> which deſired a <hi>Sober Reader</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>If thou hadſt rather we ſhould be in the right then in the wrong,</hi> &amp;c. Manifeſt Contradiction.</p>
            <p>But the Bp. to bring himſelf off, goes on thus,</p>
            <p>(Ibid. 2) <hi>Mr.</hi> P. <hi>deſires a ſtrange par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader, who ſhould have more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and affection to the Quakers (that is his Adverſaries) Opinion then his own, or who would rather be in an Error himſelf then that his Adverſaries ſhould be in any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is there no difference betwen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a People were in the Right then in the Wrong, and between chuſing rather that Himſelf were in the Wrong then his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſhould be ſo; certainly a great deal, and it looks as if the Bp. were hard put to it, when he thus argueth, Did <hi>W. P.</hi> intend or deſire ſuch a Reader as the Bp. ſtateth? No, but ſuch an one that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we were in the Right then in the Wrong, and explains it thus; <q>One that thought it but reaſonable we ſhould be Heard before Condemned, and that our Belief ought to be taken from our own Mouths and not at theirs, that hath prejudged our Cauſe.</q> In ſhort 'tis very plain, he only deſired an Impartial Reader, ſuch as the Bp. only pretended to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Ibid.</hi> 2) The Bp. tells us, He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had nor has any perſonal quarrel with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173010:11"/> 
               <hi>W. P. But, ſays the Bp. all he impleads him of</hi> (meaning <hi>W. P.) is his Doctrine, by ſpreading and defending ſuch Principles which tend to the Subverting Chriſtianity, at which no Bp. ought to connive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As this is only a general as well as a falſe charge, ſo needs no other Anſwer here but a poſitive denial, until we come to particulars, where we ſhall ſee how well the Bp. will prove his Charge. As to his not conniving, to be ſure he's at his liberty to implead, but if he ſhould do ſo again, we muſt deſire him to approve himſelf a fairer Adverſary, then he hath yet appeared, either in his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> or now in his <hi>Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>(P.</hi> 2) Says the Bp. <hi>To omit things leſs material, (P.</hi> 24) <hi>He would inſinuate the Bp. Guilty of Inſincerity in ſaying it was the firſt time he ever heard the Quakers own the Neceſſity of Chriſt as a Propitiation in order to Remiſſion of Sins, and juſtifying them as Sinners from the guilt, and tells the Bp. where poſſibly he might have read it.</hi> The Bp. makes Anſwer thus, <hi>Poſſibly the Bp. may have Read more then either he did or now does actually remember, he never had ſo much as many of the Quakers Books, much leſs has he them in his memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is firſt an Inſtance of the brevity of the Bp's. Reply, while he takes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173010:12"/> a large ſtride from <hi>(P.</hi> 20) to (24) where <hi>W. P.</hi> Enumerates and Charges the Bp. with unfair dealing by us, which the Bp. paſſeth over without notice, with ſaying, <hi>to omit things leſs Material;</hi> next as <hi>W. P.</hi> ſaid, ſo ſay we, that 'tis next to impoſſible it ſhould be the firſt time, he ſo heard of the Quakers, ſince he had read <hi>R. Barclays Apology,</hi> which largely treats of this head: But the Bp. Confeſſeth he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may have Read more then he Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which ſeems a tacit granting the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But ſuppoſe he did not actually remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this point, can it be poſſible he ſhould forget that he had Read any of the Quakers Books ſince he told <hi>W. P.</hi> ſo very lately, he had Read <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> and his Book called the <hi>Riſe and Progreſs of the Quakers;</hi> the former largely, and the latter as fully as now in <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> owning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification.—Whence it follows, if the Bp. had been an Impartial Reader, as he pretended, and one that was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to repreſent us wrong, or render us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in our Belief, he would certainly have firſt ſearched thoſe two Books before he had made this point a new diſcovery; ſo to the Impartial Reader we refer the Bp's. ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or kindneſs to the Quakers herein, and Proceed,</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:173010:12"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>(Ibid.</hi> 3) The Bp. tells us, <hi>That he has a Book now before him, Intitled,</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of the ſerious Apology for the Principles and Practices of the People called Quakers, by <hi>W. P.</hi> Printed 1671. <hi>In which</hi> (P. 148.) <hi>are theſe Words; This [namely Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath fulfilled in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for us in the Words before] We deny, and boldly affirm it to be the Doctrine of Devils, and an Arm of the Sea of Corruption, which does now deluge the whole World.</hi> (Then the Bp. adds) <hi>This the Bp. does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be owning Juſtification by Chriſt, he therefore now was glad to find</hi> Mr. P. <hi>more Orthodox in</hi> 1698. <hi>Then he was in</hi> 1671.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We would have been alſo glad to have found the Bp. more fair and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not to ſay worſe (which it will bear), then to leave out the Explanatory Part of <hi>W. P's.</hi> Words, which is as far Remote from a fair Adverſary as an Impartial Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Whereas had he been ſo juſt as to leave them in, tho' they would not have ſuited the Bp's. purpoſe, yet (together with <hi>W. P's.</hi> plain Senſe in ſeveral following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) would have made <hi>W. P.</hi> as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox (to the Impartial Reader) in 1671. As the Bp. allows him to be 1698.—For next to the Words <hi>(i e) His own Perſon for us,</hi> follow theſe Words <hi>(wholy</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:173010:13"/> 
               <hi>without us)</hi> which Words the Bp. hath wholly left out, and inſtead of them hath ſubſtituted theſe Words <hi>[in the Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore]</hi> and the Bp. hath not only thus done, but hath as we believe wilfuly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked (ſince the place was before him) <hi>W.

P.</hi> with other Articles, thus <hi>(Pag.</hi> 148.) 5th. <q>That we deny Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath fulfilled in his own Perſon for us (wholly without us) and therefore deny the Lord that Bought us:</q> To which <hi>W.

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:173010:13"/> in writing that <hi>Apology</hi> had already irrefut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably conſidered the Doctrine of Juſtification, and therefore he will not inſiſt ſo much upon this Point as he had upon others, and only adds ſome ſhort Arguments by which he proves that Wicked and Ungodly Men (while ſo) are not in a ſtate of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Acceptance with God, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righetouſneſs of Chriſt, and confirms the ſame by ſeveral Scripture Arguments; and then on the other hand ſhews that ſuch only are truly juſtified, who are obedient unto the Spirit of God, by which they become the Children of God, and bring forth fruits of Holineſs; and in confirmation hereof gives us theſe Scripture Texts. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. <hi>Reve.</hi> 22. And after having ſhewn, who are not, and who are in a ſtate of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Acceptance with God, he is ſo far from denying Juſtification by Chriſt, that he owns, aſcribes, and aſſerts the ſame alone to him, which for the Readers ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we ſhall cite his Words as they lie in that <hi>Apology</hi> following the above Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>p.</hi> 149. thus; <q>We do believe in one holy God Almighty, who is an Eternal Spirit, the Creator of all things, and in one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his only Son and expreſs Image, of his ſubſtance, who took upon him Fleſh, and was in the World, and in Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurection,

            <p>Now, Impartial Reader, judg between the Bp. and <hi>W. P.</hi> whether <hi>W. P.</hi> did deny Juſtification by Chriſt, as the Bp. would inſinuate; and whether the Bp. was led by a Chriſtian Spirit while he dealt ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly, what if we ſay unjuſtly by <hi>W. P.</hi> in miſrepreſenting his Senſe to make him ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (as we have before noted.) Now as to the Doctrine of Juſtification we ſhall not be large thereon, in regard many of our Friends have treated upon that head, and particularly (beſides <hi>W. P.</hi> in ſeveral Tracts of his) our deceaſed friend <hi>R. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> hath writ excellently and fully thereof: As alſo that the Bp. hath allowed <hi>W. P.</hi> to be Orthodox in what is written in <hi>Goſpel Truths</hi> upon that Point; for theſe Reaſons we ſhall be brief: yet as <hi>W. P.</hi> ſaid in 1671. ſo ſay we now, that we cannot believe it other then a Sin-pleaſing Notion and a Doctrine of Divels (ſince all Men, as the Scriptures tell us, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to their deeds) to aſſert, That Wicked and Ungodly Men (while they continue ſo) are in a ſtate of Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:173010:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Juſtification with God by the righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath fulfilled in his own perſon, <hi>wholly without them,</hi> which wholy excludes the Work of Sanctification wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt, which was the Notion <hi>W. P.</hi> did briefly, and <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> more largely, diſpute againſt in that ſerious <hi>Apology,</hi> ſee <hi>(p.</hi> the 37 to 40) and <hi>(p.</hi> 148) and agreeable to the Quakers ſenſe and belief in this point are theſe following Scriptures <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21, 22, 23. &amp; ſo 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>James</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 35. In ſhort, altho' we firmly believe, and which <hi>W. P.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> hath aſſerted, that only Jeſus Chriſt is our Juſtifier, yet we do not believe any are truly juſtified in the ſight of God, but ſuch who yield obedience to the Spirit of Chriſt in themſelves, by which they come to do the will of God, and thereby come to obtain the benefit of what Chriſt fulfilled in his own perſon <hi>without us;</hi> in concurrance whereunto we have theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 11, 13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. and 12. 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7. 8. Now to draw toward a concluſion upon this head; Having proved from that ſerious <hi>Apology</hi> in 1671. That <hi>W. P.</hi> did aſcribe our Juſtification only to Chriſt, and our <hi>Reconciliation with God to faith in his blood;</hi> But grants the benefit of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:173010:15"/> it only to ſuch, who obey the Spirit of God in themſelves: Let us now ſee whether he be not of the ſame mind and hath aſerted the ſame Doctrine in 1698. which the Bp. commends as Orthodox; Thus, <hi>Goſpel Truth.</hi> IV. <q>That as we are only juſtified from the guilt of Sin, by Chriſt the Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and not by works of Righteouſneſs that we have done, ſo there is an abſolute neceſſity, that we receive and obey, to unfeigned repentance and amendment of Life, the holy Light and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, in order to obtain that Remiſſion and Juſtification from Sin; ſince no Man can be juſtified by Chriſt, who walks not after the Spirit, but after the fleſh, for whom he ſanctifies, them he alſo juſtifies; and if we walk in the Light as he is Light, his precious Blood cleanſeth us from all Sin, as well from the pollution, as guilt of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. to 26. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7.</q> We will not ſpend farther time to comment upon the matter, to ſhew how agreeable <hi>W. P's.</hi> Belief was in 1671. to what it was in 1698. being ſo very plain that it would be but time loſt ſo to do, and therefore we leave it with the Impartial Reader. Again, the Bp,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſays</hi> W. P. <hi>if the Bp. commends their believing in Chriſt as a propitiation for Sin, he ought not to have cenſured them as ſhort in</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:173010:15"/> 
               <hi>any fundamental Article of Chriſtian Religion; for that all the reſt follow from, or are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this;</hi> (p. 25. 26.) truly, <hi>ſays the Bp. he ought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here again we muſt charge the Bp. with unfairneſs in laying down words directly as <hi>W. P's.</hi> in a Different Character, (the better to make them appear to be his) and foiſting in ſeveral that are none of his; the Bp. Cites, <hi>p.</hi> 25. 26. <hi>Firſt</hi> Impreſſion, for theſe words, and therefore we will lay down <hi>W. P's.</hi> words in theſe two pages from whence the Bp. pretends to take them, and then let the Reader judg in the matter, Thus <hi>W. P. (p.</hi> 28.) the 2<hi>d.</hi> Impreſſion, <q>Who ever believes in Chriſt as a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in order to remiſſion of Sins and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Sinners from the guilt of Sin, can hardly disbelieve any fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Religion.</q> Then goes on to prove that ſuch a Believer muſt neceſſarily believe in God, becauſe it is with him alone Man is to be juſtified in Chriſt, becauſe that is the very Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in the holy Ghoſt, becauſe he is the Author of his Conviction, Repentance, and Belief <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See that page, again. <hi>p.</hi> 28. Adds thus, <q>So that acknowledging the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Chriſt as a Propitiation, in order to the remiſſion of Sin, comprehends the main Doctrine of Chriſtian Religion, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:173010:16"/> as ſo many lines drawn from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Center, they all meet and center in Chriſt, and indeed it is as the Navel of Chriſtianity and Characteriſtick of that Religion. I would intreat him <hi>(meaning the Bp.)</hi> again to reflect well upon his own acknowledgment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of our Belief concerning the end and benefit of Chriſt to mankind, and he cannot think us ſo deficient, much leſs under ſuch ſtrong and dangerous deluſions as he has been pleaſed to repreſent us.</q> Thus <hi>W. P.</hi> in theſe tvvo pages vvhich vve vvould have our Reader to compare vvith vvhat the Bp. has laid dovvn as his: And <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> ſee vvhat juſt ground the Bp. could have had to raiſe ſuch contradiction had he taken <hi>W. P's.</hi> ovvn vvords. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> Whether the Bp. did vvell in Quoting theſe vvords di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly as <hi>W. P's.</hi> vvithout giving notice he drevv them conſequentially, vvhich in juſtice he ought to have done; But to be ſure very unfair in him to add ſeveral vvords never ſpoke by <hi>W. P.</hi> for beſides packing the vvhole together (vvithout any break) as <hi>W. P's.</hi> vvhich are none of his as they lye, he has added theſe [for all the reſt follovv from] But vve novv come to his Arguments deduced from the premiſes he has made for <hi>W. P.</hi> Says the Bp. (meaning himſelf) <hi>He does not find the Quakers to be</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:173010:16"/> 
               <hi>ſo good at believing or drawing due conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, or deducing and diſcovering all the particulars comprehended in generalls.</hi> To vvhich vve anſvver in ſhort that vve do not vvonder he ſhould tell us ſo, vvho ſo ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly endeavours to miſrepreſent us, not only in what's paſt, but in much that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>(2) (Says the Bp.) <hi>It is not true that all the fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from, or are comprehended in this Doctrine, Chriſt is our Propitiation, ſome of them (particularly mentioned by Mr.</hi> P.) <hi>do not thence follow, as that there is a holy Ghoſt, that he convinceth Men of Sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nay not that</hi> (p. 34.) <hi>That Chriſt is aſcended, for he might have been a Propitiation and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (as were thoſe under the Law) and yet never have aſcended no nor roſe again.</hi> Mind Reader the words [all] and <hi>[follow from]</hi> nor the deduced words <hi>[does not thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low]</hi> were not ſpoke by <hi>W. P.</hi> But leaving that with thee we will now attend to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>W. P's.</hi> words: Then ſay we by the ſame rule, <hi>That no Man can ſay Jeſus is the Lord but by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> as ſaith the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. Nor no Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or ſavingly believe or <hi>know the things of God but by the Spirit of God,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. (tho' we confeſs they may and do pretend to both
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173010:17"/> traditionally) ſo likewiſe no Man can truly and ſavingly believe Chriſt as a <hi>Propitiation</hi> in order to the remiſſion of Sin, but by the ſame Spirit, and as ſuch, a true Believer hath the holy Ghoſt for the authour of his ſaving conviction and belief; ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he muſt believe there is a holy Ghoſt, as <hi>W. P.</hi> well obſerveth, and which convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for Sin, according to <hi>John</hi> 16 18. But that we may not be miſunderſtood, we do not here mean of ſuch extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as of the knowledg of the outward Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> death and ſufferings, but as of the illumination of the holy Ghoſt in ſuch agreeing with the holy Scriptures. But as to ſuch, from whom God hath with-held the knowledge of the Scriptures, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hiſtory, we ſhall ſpeak of that in its place; in the mean time we ſay he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves as aforeſaid, to give <hi>W. P's.</hi> own words, <q>Can hardly disbelieve any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article of Chriſtian Religion, and comprehends the main Doctrine of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and as ſo many lines drawn from the Circumference to the Center, they all Center in Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then as to the Bp's. ſaying, <hi>Chriſt might have been a Propitiation and Sacrifice (as were thoſe under the Law) and yet never have aſcended, no nor roſe again.</hi> To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the diſproportion between the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:173010:17"/> under the Law, and the one Sacrifice of Chriſt for the remiſſion of Sins, we ask how came the Bp. ſo greatly to ofr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelf, thus to aſſert both in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the holy Scriptures, as well as his friend <hi>Geo Keith,</hi> (whom he quotes as a cloſe evidence againſt us) for to the owning of and belief in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for the remiſſion of Sins (as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath done)? It was no leſs neceſſary to that end, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould riſe again, as that he ſhould ſuffer: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. (beſides other Scriptures which for brevity we omit) Where ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt, who was delivered for our Offences and raiſed again for our Juſtification,</hi> here the Apoſtle makes Chriſts ſuffering <hi>and riſing again</hi> neceſſary to his being a <hi>Propitiation,</hi> contrary to the Bp. Next, <hi>G. Keith</hi> in page. 26. of his firſt Narrative, ſays expresſly thus, <hi>I ſay with them and all Chriſtendom that if Chriſt had died and not riſen again he could not have been an attonement for our Sins;</hi> this is ſo full and contrary to the Bp's. Aſſertion, that we think 'twill both puzzle the Bp. and his Advocate <hi>G. K.</hi> to reconcile the contradiction. But it may be hoped the Bp. will retract, rather then have <hi>G. K.</hi> and (if he can believe <hi>G. K.</hi> as readily againſt himſelf as he doth againſt us) all Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom againſt him.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:173010:18"/>
            <p> Now to his third head, (ſaith the Bp.) thus, <hi>To tell Mr.</hi> P. <hi>thus much as to his Paper once for all, Implication of Faith is not a profeſſion of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We allow 'tis not ſo in all caſes as we ſhall find it in the Bp. hereafter, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in pages 19, 20. of his <hi>Reply,</hi> and ſuch ſtrange ſort of Implications too as that we think no ſuch conſequence can poſſibly be deduced from his premiſes, as he makes; but in our caſe it is otherwiſe, and had he been an Impartial Reader, as he pretended, and had had but a grain of Charity in him towards us, it would have ſaved all this work, while that Paper called <hi>Goſpel Truths</hi> vvas but a brief account (as it tells us) and the Bp. had <hi>R. Barcla's Apology</hi> vvhich ſtates and vindicates moſt of our Principles largely, as alſo <hi>W. P's. Riſe and Progreſs of the Quakers</hi> doth ſeveral of them briefly, vvhich, vve ſhould think, vvould have ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied moſt or all of his Objections if he vvere not reſolved rather to repreſent us vvrong than right, vvhich vve muſt needs ſay doth but too much appear in his management to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards us. But farther, as to Implication of Faith: ſince the Bp. can produce no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith extant ſo compleat and full, that nothing is left to be made out by Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he might have ſhevved ſo much can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, as to have given an equal allovvance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:173010:18"/> (at leaſt) to this ſhort Declaration (vvhich vvas not vvrit as <hi>W. P.</hi> told him in the Preface to his Defence for an exact and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat account of our Belief) as he vvould to any of thoſe Creeds or Symbols of Faith, which himſelf or the Church he is of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth; which had he done, he could not have charged our Confeſſion touching the Beeing of God with imperfection, becauſe there is not in it a word of God's creating the preſent World, or ſupporting it by his Providence, or concerning Himſelf about the inanimate part thereof, with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (he ſaith) of other particulars; for in which we pray of all the Creeds, which the Bp. holds Authentick, is this multitude of particulars expreſt, in the firſt Article touching the Beeing of God without impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? If we look into that which bears the name of the Apoſtles Creed the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is delivered thus. <hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth;</hi> what one word is here of ſupporting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world by his providence, of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf about the inanimate part of it, or of the Bp's. multitude of other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars? Are not all thoſe to be made out by implication, in this the moſt celebrated, and beſt Creed extent? Again, Is there one word in that Creed concerning the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion or Mediation of Chriſt for his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:173010:19"/> People? It is ſaid indeed, <hi>he aſcended into Heaven, and ſitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, and that from thence he ſhall come to judg the Quick and the Dead:</hi> But that, ſitting at the Right Hand of his Father, he makes Interceſſion for his People (tho' it be certainly true <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.) is not expreſt in that Creed but left to be ſupplied by implication. Yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Attributes due to God, even thoſe which the Bp. ſays Chriſtianity teacheth of him, where are they in words expreſt in that Creed? Is there a word there, of his Omniſcience, his Omnipreſence, his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs and Love to Mankinde, his Juſtice, Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Will the Bp. allow theſe to be made out by implication, or would he have them left out and disbelieved altogether? By theſe Inſtances the Bp. we hope, will ſee how much his deſire of a blow at <hi>W. P.</hi> and the Quakers made him miſtake, when he ſaid <hi>(p.</hi> 4, 5.) <hi>What an eaſie prevention of all this Imperfection and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty had it been for</hi> W. P. <hi>and his party to have ſaid,</hi> I believe in God the Father Almighty maker of Heaven and Earth; ſince that, without the help of Implication, falls very much ſhort of delivering what he ſays Chriſtianity teacheth of God; To which he adds, <hi>but this had been confeſſing an Article of Faith in a way beneath their Light,</hi> we ſay
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:173010:19"/> no more but that, this is a Scoff beneath the gravity which the Bp. pretends to, and was expected from him: But we muſt take leave to tell him, that by his rejecting that Paper called <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> and unchriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us for our ſhortneſs in not expreſſing in that Paper all that Chriſtianity teacheth, and that is to be believed concerning God, Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt, and other Articles of Chriſtian Religion, he has given a deep wound to the common Creed (called the Apoſtles) and to all the Creeds in the Chriſtian World, and ſtruck a very bold ſtroke towards unchriſtianing all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>But in this we think the Bp. the more to be blamed, in as much as when he writ this, he declares he had before him a Book of <hi>W. P's.</hi> Entitled, <hi>The ſecond part of the ſerious Apology for the principles and practices of the People called Quakers,</hi> Printed in the Year 1671. in which he might, (and could ſcarce but) ſee a more full Confeſſion of Faith, concerning the Eſſentials of Religion, God, Chriſt, and Holy Spirit: We ſay he could hardly miſs ſeeing this, for he took (and that moſt falſely, as we have ſhewed before,) a quotation out of that Book (in <hi>p.</hi> 148.) and this Confeſſion which we now mention is in page, 149. and the pages lye open together, ſo that both are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:173010:20"/> expoſed to the eye at the ſame time. This Confeſſion is in theſe words, <q>We do believe in one only Holy God Almighty, who is an eternal Spirit, the Creator of all things;</q> We would gladly know whether this be not as full, as expreſs, as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, as the firſt Article in that which is called the Apoſtles Creed, which ſays only, <hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty maker of Heaven and Earth.</hi> It follows in that Book of <hi>W. P's.</hi> 
               <q>And in one Lord Jeſus Chriſt his only Son and expreſs Image of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, who took upon him fleſh, and was in the World, and in Life, Doctrine, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Death, <hi>Reſurrection, Aſcention</hi> and <hi>Mediation;</hi> perfectly did and does conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to do the will of God; to whoſe Holy Life, Power, Mediation and Blood we only aſcribe our Sanctification, Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Redemption and perfect Salvation:</q> Here is a full Confeſſion both to the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Manhood of Chriſt, his Birth, Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention, and (which the common Creed mentions not) his Mediation. Then for the Holy Spirit; whereas the Creed has on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt, W. P's.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is more full in theſe words, <q>And we believe in one Holy Spirit, that proceeds and breaths from the Father and the Son as the life and virtue of both the Father
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:173010:20"/> and the Son, a meaſure of which is given to all to profit with, and he that has one has all, for theſe three are one, who is the Alpha, and Omega, the firſt, and laſt God over all, bleſſed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </q> This we ſuppoſe the Bp. will acknowledge to be a more full and plain Confeſſion then that which is in the Common Creed. (called the Apoſtles) with reſpect to the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Spirit, from the Father and the Son, not touched in that, beſides what is ſaid in this, concerning the great miſtery of the God-head, [one in three and three in one] commonly expreſt by the word <hi>(Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity)</hi> of which that Creed (called the Apoſtles) is wholly ſilent. Now ſince the Bp. acknowledges he had that Book of <hi>W. P's.</hi> then before him, out of which we have recited this Confeſſion, which in many material parts is ſo much fuller and larger, then that the Bp. directs to, how unfair and how diſingenious; how uncharitable is the Bp. towards <hi>W. P.</hi> and us, to cenſure and unchriſtian us for a pretended ſhortneſs in the wording of ſome of our Principles; and that too after <hi>W. P.</hi> had told him in the Preface to his <hi>Defence,</hi> that that Paper, which he gave the Bp. was not writ for an exact and compleat account of our Belief; and in the <hi>Defence.</hi> page. 25. to 28. had declared, that to believe in God is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173010:21"/> him, Omnipotent, Omniſcient, and Omnipreſent; and that in believing in Chriſt as a propitiation in order to remiſſion of Sins and juſtification of Sinners from the guilt of Sin, was included not only believing in God, Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit, but a belief of Heaven, Hell, Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and conſequently the Reſurrection of the Juſt and Unjuſt; this one would think had been enough to have ſatisfied the Bp. or any one elſe, that had not a mind to miſrepreſent or cavil, which it may be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bp. has.</p>
            <p>As to what the Bp. ſaith <hi>(p.</hi> 4) <hi>A great Man has told us of the Gentile world and their belief in multiplicity of Gods,</hi> &amp;c. It nothing concerns us, we are not accountable for their, but our own, belief, and had <hi>W. P.</hi> been to preſent ſome heathen Pontiff with our Confeſſion of Faith concerning God and his Attributes, no doubt he would have been more explicit and large, then what is contained, not only in the Paper called <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> but even in that Creed called the Apoſtles: But while he intended that Paper for profeſſed Chriſtians, he thought what was delivered therein concerning God, ſufficient to ſatisfie any who had not a mind to cavil. But ſo earneſt is the Bp. in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of <hi>W. P.</hi> and the Quakers, that in ſeeking occaſion againſt them, he plainly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173010:21"/> miſtakes the Scriptures, which we now come to ſhew. Thus the Bp. <hi>(p.</hi> 4.) <hi>Mr.</hi> P. <hi>ſaith that</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>ſeems expreſt for a declaration of faith in God. The Bp. takes the freedom to inform him, that it was not at all intended for a full confeſſion of Chriſtian Faith, as to that Article thereof, touching the Beeing, Nature, and Works of God, but only of ſuch an initial or natural Faith which Men had or might have without Revelation; for of the Faith of ſuch, viz.</hi> Abell <hi>and</hi> Enoch, <hi>and thoſe who lived before the Flood without any Revelation that we read of, he there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</hi> Thus the Bp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We anſwer for <hi>W. P.</hi> that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wants nor deſires the Bp's. Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs it were more agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then we ſhall find this.—The Bp's. words here doth conſiſt of two parts, the one, <hi>that the Faith of</hi> Abell, Enoch, <hi>and thoſe who lived before the Flood was initial and natural, without any revelation that we read of:</hi> Next that <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſuch a natural Faith;</hi> now if we prove the firſt was divine Faith and the laſt was no diſcourſe of natural Faith, it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follows the Bp. hath miſrepreſented the Scriptures; to which purpoſe we will begin with the firſt verſe in the Chapter. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Now faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:173010:22"/> that this Faith was not natural but divine Faith according to <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. appears very plainly from the context, by the effects it produced; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>By it the Elders obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good report.</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>Through Faith we underſtand the worlds were made by the word of God.</hi> Verſ. 4. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abell <hi>offered unto God a more acceptable Sacrifice then</hi> Cain, <hi>by which he obtained witneſs that he was righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Verſ. 5. <hi>By Faith</hi> Enoch <hi>was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee Death, for before his tranſlation he had this Teſtimony that he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God.</hi> Now to the 6. Verſ. <hi>Which the Bp. ſays was a diſcourſe of natural and initial Faith.</hi> Verſ. 6. <hi>But without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe him; for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> (mind, Reader, the laſt part of this Verſe was a part of what was laid down in <hi>Goſpel Truths</hi> for our belief in God) Verſ. 7. <hi>By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God of things not ſeen, as yet moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his houſe, by which he condemned the World, and became heir of righteouſneſs by Faith.</hi> So the Apoſtle proceeds to the end of that Chapter (which is long) ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great and extraordinary effects of this divine Faith. The Bp. ſeems to reſtrain the Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Only to the Faith of thoſe, who lived before the Flood:</hi> But the Apoſtle
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:173010:22"/> paſſes on from <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarchs who lived between the Flood and the Law; nor does the Apoſtle put any difference between the Faith of thoſe before the Flood, between the Flood and the Law, or under the Law, which the Bp. may do well to conſider: as alſo that <hi>Jude</hi> ſays expresſly <hi>Enoch</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, ſee <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. Will he ſay he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied without Revelation? But to ſhorten upon the firſt head; Thoſe Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cited do ſo plainly prove our point, that we need not trouble the Reader with any more to ſhew that it was not natural but ſupernatural Faith (thoſe holy Men were endued withall) by which (in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) Enoch <hi>propheſied and was tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and Noah <hi>was warned to build the Ark,</hi> which beſides the reſt are two ſuch plain and extraordinary inſtances of ſupernatural Faith by Revelation from God, that we cannot but admire the Bp. ſhould aſſert thoſe who lived before the Flood had no Revelation that we read of, but what was natural and initial: We leave it with the Reader and proceed to the ſecond part, in which the Bp. aſſerted that <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Was not at all intended for a full confeſſion of Chriſtian Faith, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Beeing, Nature, and Works of God, but of natural and initial Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:173010:23"/>
            <p> To which we anſwer (as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn) they had divine Faith and Revelation before the Flood; ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Bp's. Arguments do fall in courſe: However the Text it ſelf, with the context very plainly intends ſpiritual and divine Faith, not only with reſpect to thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effects produced by true Faith, as well before as after the Flood, but alſo ſeems expreſſed, (as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath aſſerted) for Faith in God, (And) we ſay (Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith too, becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the preſent tenſe) notwithſtanding his Attributes be not there enumerated, no more then they were by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the word <hi>[I am]</hi> Inſtanced by <hi>W. P.</hi> but paſt over in ſilence by the Bp. Now to that <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. We take leave to ask the Bp. what Faith it was <hi>they were to come unto God by,</hi> and without which it was impoſſible to pleaſe him, whether was it Natural and initial, or Spiritual and ſupernatural Faith; if he anſwers (as he ſaid before) Natural, we tell him that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, ſince the Scripture tells us, <hi>all were by nature Children of wrath,</hi> and that Man naturally has nothing, nor can perform any thing acceptable to God; ſee theſe Texts <hi>John</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Pro.</hi> 20. 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Beſides many other Scriptures; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently then, that Faith mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. intended no other then divine and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:173010:23"/> ſupernatural Faith as doth moſt plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, not only from the Text, but alſo from the context, as we have ſhewn. Thus, Reader, ſee how the Bp. has miſtaken plain Scripture, no wonder then if he miſtake us, <hi>&amp;c.—</hi>The Bp. proceeds,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 5. Again ſaith the Bp. <hi>The acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of future rewards and puniſhments, no more infers the reſurrection from the Dead or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Torments to the Damned, then any of the former points imply what</hi> W. P. <hi>would have comprehended in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they imply but as much we ſhall eaſily clear our ſelves from the Bp's. ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of Heatheniſm or Sociniaſm, for we think the other points are plainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, as we have above ſhewn; ſo by this rule there needs no farther return to that, to an unbyaſſed Reader.—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we will attend the Bp's. Arguments who proceeds to tell us of <hi>one Syneſius a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Phyloſopher</hi> (to ſay no more) <hi>who profeſt he could not believe the reſurrection of the Body; and of</hi> Origen, <hi>and the merciful Doctors, who believed future rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, yet believed not eternal torments, it had been neceſſary therefore ſaith the Bp. for him</hi> (i. e. W. P.) <hi>and his Brethren explicitly to have declared their belief of theſe main Articles, the Reſurrection and eternal Torments even among the Truths, chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:173010:24"/> 
               <hi>by them, that we might have known the Quakers to be neither Heathens nor Socinians in theſe points, which herein it is plain they may be notwithſtanding their belief that God is a rewarder of them who ſeek him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Syneſius</hi> was not only a Chriſtian Phyloſopher but a Biſhop too which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Bp. was willing to hide with his Parentheſis, <hi>(to ſay no more,)</hi> the ſtory we have in <hi>Evagrius</hi> Eccleſiaſtick Hiſtory <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> 15. The old Edition, tells us he could not believe the reſurrection of the fleſh, how ſtated to him we have no account, but if in ſo groſs a manner as ſome have done it in our days we cannot wonder he did not receive it; However tho' he did not receive the vulgar opinion, (for ſo we have it in <hi>Valleſius</hi> his notes in the new Edition) Yet we find the Chriſtians in thoſe times <hi>(viz.</hi> about the Year, 412.) perſwaded him not only to be Baptized but to take upon him the Office of a Biſhop, and he did ſo; whence we obſerve that the vulgar opinion, or the Doctrine of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Fleſh was not then held ſo Eſſential to the Chriſtian Religion but that a Man might be both a Chriſtian and a Bp. too, tho' he neither did nor would believe it. But to proceed, what ever opinion in reallity he held, or others did or do believe, is nothing to us, we are not accountable for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:173010:24"/> their Faith but our own. <hi>(1ſt.</hi> then) then. As to the Reſurrection from the Dead, we have always believed and owned it by word and writing according to holy Scripture, and which was again fully owned by <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Defence. p.</hi> 47. 48. Where he alſo ſhews, 'twas ſufficiently implyed in <hi>Goſpel Truths</hi> by future rewards and puniſhments: And ſo ſay we too, otherwiſe we muſt disbelieve the immortality of the Soul, and, believe that it dies with the body which we firmly deny. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> As to eternity of Torments to the Damned we have (likewiſe) alſo ſtedfaſtly believed it, and <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Defence. p.</hi> 43, 44. hath ſhewn it is fully implyed in <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> which we will not farther enlarge upon here becauſe we will cut ſhort and tell the Bp. tho' we will not downright charge him with Inſincerity (what ever it deſerves) yet we think we may ſafely with great partiality (to charge us with ſhortneſs in this point) while he had in his poſſeſſion (before his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> or <hi>Reply</hi> was writ) a Book called the <hi>Riſe and progreſs of the Quakers,</hi> which in (page the. 38.) hath theſe words.—<q>This leads us to the acknowledgment of Eternal Rewards and Puniſhments, for elſe of all People certainly they <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Quakers) muſt be moſt miſerable, who for about forty years have been exceeding great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:173010:25"/> for their profeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Now for the Bp. after this to make this objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, looks indeed very ſtrange, and to be ſure like one that was willing, as <hi>W. P.</hi> ſays, to repreſent us wrong rather then we ſhould be in the right.—But farther, as to Eternal Torments tho' what is ſaid before is ſufficient; yet we cannot but obſerve how unreaſonable the Bp. is to Quarrel with us, for not expreſſing that as an Article of Faith, which is not expreſſed in his own Creed (if that called the Apoſtles be his); for what word in the Creed is there of Eternal Torments, 'tis indeed ſaid therein, <hi>I believe the Life everlaſting,</hi> but not a word of Puniſhments being everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If the Bp. ſay, that the reward of Life to the Righteous, being everlaſting, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the puniſhment of the Damned ſhall be everlaſting, may we not then with a great deal of reaſon return his own words, (<hi>p.</hi> 3.) and tell him, Thus much as to that point once for all, Implication of Faith is not a profeſſion of Faith, at leaſt ought not to be claimed by him, that will not allovv it to others. Again, How hath the Bp. caught himſelf in his own Trap; for while his own Creed is ſilent in ſo main a point as Eternal Puniſhments (as he tells us that is) which way will the Bp. Extricate himſelf and his brethren (to give him his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:173010:25"/> own phraſe) from being ſuſpected to be either Heathens or Socinians in that point: If he ſay that this which he calls a main Article is explicitly declared in ſome other Creeds or Declarations of Faith, the Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is, So are they alſo in other Books and writings of ours; and if the Bp. would have given to others the ſame meaſure he takes himſelf, he might have forborn this unneceſſary wrangle.</p>
            <p>The end of <hi>(p.</hi> 5. and moſt of <hi>p.</hi> 6.) is about the Trinity, in which point, we find the Bp. ſtill reſolves to have us ſhort, and imperfect, tho' it be by telling of us again much of it word for word, as he did in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> Thus 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſumm of what the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teacheth, nor a ſufficient confeſſion of Faith, of the holy Trinity.</hi> Then adds, <hi>He</hi> [meaning <hi>W. P.] inſinnuates (which is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly falſe) that the Bp. ſlights that, as a by paſſage or of little credit,</hi> upon which the Bp. appeals to his own <hi>Paper;</hi> then tells us of the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> and <hi>Thirty Nine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> then to <hi>W. P's.</hi> demand from the Bp. of the occaſion of the Apoſtles ſpeaking as he did, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. the Bp. returns thus; <hi>The Bp. anſwers out of</hi> Verſ. 1. 5. <hi>It was to prove that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> and after ſome more to the ſame purpoſe the Bp. concludes that paragraph, ſaying <hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>This</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:173010:26"/> 
               <hi>was his purpoſe</hi> (i. e. <hi>John) viz.</hi> to ſettle the Believers Faith in Chriſt) <hi>and not fully there to declare the Doctrine of the Trinity, which is no where done in any one text of Scripture, but is to be gathered out of many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is it not ſtrange, Reader, that the Bp. who ſo ſtrangely condemned that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (of <hi>Goſpel Truths)</hi> as ſhort and defective for not being more explicit, and full in others as well as in this point, ſhould now a ſecond time, be ſo very defective himſelf, as not to tell us, where thoſe many Texts are, by which the Trinity was to be proved? No, that he has not done, for a good reaſon too, becauſe in all the Scriptures a more full proof could not be found, then 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. But the Bp. to help himſelf, tells us of the <hi>Thirty Nine Articles and Nicene Creed.</hi> To which we anſwer, their foundation in that point ought to be the Holy Scripture; if ſo, why had not the Bp. cited or referred us to thoſe Scriptures, but in ſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the <hi>Trinity,</hi> we think he has rather leſſened the proof thereof, while he tells us the Apoſtles purpoſe was to prove that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God: for altho' the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles could not prove the Trinity without proving Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God; yet as the Bp. aſſignes that Text. (by the context) chiefly to prove Chriſt was the Son of God, we ask doth he not thereby
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173010:26"/> leſſen the proof of the Trinity? vvhile (as we ſaid above) we can no where find ſo full and plain a Text in all the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to prove the Trinity; we are ſure we deſign not to ſtrain, or miſrepreſent the Bp's. ſenſe, but what we have ſaid, we think, naturally follows from his own words, and far leſs then we could have ſaid on the matter. As to his appeal to his <hi>Paper,</hi> we agree in that point, provided <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> be compared with it, and there the Impartial Reader will ſee whether <hi>W. P.</hi> hath wronged the Bp's Senſe or not, and whether the Bp. hath not now confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>W. P's.</hi> asking, How came <hi>the Bp. to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it a by paſſage,</hi> and the Text it ſelf ſhort, and otherwiſe intended by the Apoſtle, then an Article of Faith <hi>about the Trinity?</hi> ſee. <hi>p.</hi> 33. of <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> (in two places): and thus we end as to what the Bp. has ſaid about the Trinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 6, 7. The Bp. tells us we muſt give a more explicit confeſſion of our Faith if we expect to be accounted Chriſtians, for other reaſons then he has given; <hi>eſpecially</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this for one, that a great Perſon among them who profeſſes, as concerning their Principles, he was deceived by them, thinking they had held ſincerely the Principles, which by a more diligent ſearch he finds, they hold not.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:173010:27"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Anſw. George Keith</hi> being the perſon he means (as appears in the Margin) we muſt take leave to ſay, the Bp. is greatly miſtaken, for he is neither great among us, nor indeed of us at all, having been denied by us ſome Years paſt; and as to that Man, he muſt either have been a great Hypocrite formerly, or a foul Apoſtate now from us, The former, if for about thirty Years he walkt among us, and defended our Principles by word and writing, and yet at the ſame time was not convinced of the verity of them; an Apoſtate to be ſure if being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of our Principles, and from that perſwaſion defended them, while now he retracts, and condemns ſome of the very ſame Principles he then defended.</p>
            <p>The Bp. proceeds about <hi>G Keith (p.</hi> 7.) <hi>aſſures us</hi> (meaning <hi>G. K.)</hi> and <hi>has Printed Teſtimonies out of their Books to prove they deny.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to <hi>G. Keith's</hi> confident aſſurance, we queſtion not that, he having given us ſufficient proof thereof already, by plainly perverting and miſrepreſenting our friends words and writings as well as contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what he has before writ, in defence of us and our principles: and did we only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer back to our friends reitterated (as well as <hi>G. K's.</hi> own former writings) they would ſufficiently prove us Orthodox, as to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173010:27"/> four following points brought by the Bp. from <hi>G. K's.</hi> Third Narrative; however becauſe the Bp. ſhall not have occaſion to ſay, we paſs them over, we will briefly conſider them: <hi>(1ſt.) That they</hi> (i. e. the Quakers) <hi>deny Faith in Chriſt as he outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>as he roſe again, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and now ſits at the right hand of God to be neceſſary to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If <hi>G. K.</hi> doth here mean that the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the outward death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt, is ſo neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as without the <hi>knowledg</hi> of which all Men are damned and eternally loſt; we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we dare not be ſo uncharitable as to conclude, that the many millions of Men, who are and have been in the World, and who never had, or heard of the outward hiſtory of the ſufferings and death of Chriſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo damned, provided they yield obedience to the Spirit of God in them ſelves, and thereby from unholy become Holy Men.</p>
            <p>But if he mean with reſpect to the Quakers, and ſuch who have had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the outward hiſtory, as recorded in Holy Scriptures, we hold it abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſo to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(2ly.)</hi> That <hi>we deny Juſtification by the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed.</hi>

            <p> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this head we have ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the Bp. himſelf hath allowed <hi>W. P.</hi> Orthodox in what is written in <hi>Goſpel Truth,</hi> ſo we need ſay no more of this now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(3ly.)</hi> That we <hi>deny the Reſurrection of the Body that dieth.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:173010:29"/> unjuſt perverting and miſrepreſenting way of dealing by our Friends; that 'tis paſt his power by ſuch his foul, way it ſelf to prove <hi>W. P.</hi> denyed any one of the Truths, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Creed called the Apoſtles, much leſs that he did not hold one of them ſoundly and intirely. And as to our <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning the Doctrine of the Scriptures,</hi> as he ſays, what ſhall we ſay of ſuch a Man as <hi>G. K's.</hi> thoughts of others, who (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) knew not his own for ſo many Years; If he were to be meaſured by his now writing againſt thoſe things he ſo many Years defended. In ſhort a Malitious Adverſary, and Apoſtate was never a good Evidence againſt the People he deſerted, and ſuch to be ſure is <hi>G. K.</hi> againſt the Quakers. And ſhould we ask the Bp. whether he will grant that a Deſerter from, and an Enemy to, the <hi>Church of England</hi> is a good Evidence againſt that Church, we belive he would hardly allow it; with what reaſon then could the Bp. bring, <hi>G. K's.</hi> Evidence againſt the Quakers: And as to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we aſſert for the Quakers againſt either <hi>his really thinks,</hi> or other his more bold aſſertions, that no people in the World, doth more truly own the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures then they do: Now as to the Bp's. demanding a better Confeſſion of Faith then by meer <hi>Innuendo's</hi> (by which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:173010:30"/> we ſuppoſe he means <hi>Goſpel Truths.)</hi> We anſwer him (as we did before) if he had been an impartial Reader as he pretended, and had eſteemed that Paper too ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in ſome points, he would have ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>R. B's. Apology,</hi> where he would have found moſt, if not all thoſe Points, (beſides others) largely and fully handled, before he would have ſo expoſed us under a falſe diſguiſe to the World, as he did in his <hi>Teſtimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (7.) (The Bp. tells us) <hi>Mr.</hi> Penn <hi>tells the World he and his Brethren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the Articles of the Creed (called the Apoſtles,) but this may be reckoned one of the good effects the Bp's. Paper has had to bring them to this acknowledgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All things conſidered we think the Bp. has no reaſon to be highly conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his <hi>Paper;</hi> for what ever good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he has of it himſelf, we believe few, if any, impartial Men has the like; more eſpecialy ſuch, who have read <hi>W. P's. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> If he could have told us and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with proved <hi>W. P.</hi> and his Brethren had ever disbelieved the Truths contained in that Creed (which <hi>W. P.</hi> ſays we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) he might with more reaſon have told the World this, and we tell him, if he had read only ſome of the ſeveral Tracts of <hi>W. P's.</hi> in particular (not to mention many
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173010:30"/> other of our Friends) he might have found him owning all the Truths contained in that Creed, called the Apoſtles, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar he cannot be ignorant of his owning the moſt eſſential, to wit, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, (we think) as fully expreſt in ſome parts, and more fully in others then in that Creed, even in that ſerious <hi>Apology. (p.</hi> 149.) before obſerved, which lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, if he had never read any other of his Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (7.) Now the Bp. begins to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the road and inſtead of regularly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering page by page, he fetches a large ſtep (in his next charge) from <hi>(p.</hi> 30. to 104.) then backwards, other times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then here, then there, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times no page at all; for which let us hear the Bp's. reaſon, or rather his pretence he gives us for ſo doing. <hi>(p.</hi> 7.) <hi>It would be</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as endleſs as needleſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides would ſwell this Paper to too great a Bulk to follow Mr.</hi> P. <hi>page by page to the end, replying to all his little Cavills and poor Evaſions: A more compendious way,</hi> (ſaith the Bp.) <hi>therefore muſt be taken, which ſhall be (firſt) by reducing Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>Anſwers and Arguments to ſome common Heads or Figures of Speech, which he uſes, ſo contemptible in themſelves, as that the inſtances of them are anſwered by being ſhewn.</hi> And <hi>(2ly) by ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:173010:31"/> 
               <hi>out the more material points, wherein Mr.</hi> P. <hi>enlarges, and ſetting them in their true light.</hi> Thus the Bp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We confeſs the Bp. hath not only found out a more compendious, but alſo a new way to anſwer his Opponent; for in ſtead of anſwering <hi>W. P's.</hi> Anſwers and Arguments in order, as they lay in his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> (like a fair Diſputant,) he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to reduce them to ſome common heads or figures of Speech, and ſingle out (as he ſays) the more material points, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No doubt the Bp. underſtood what he did, for by ſo doing he could the better drop the weight and force of <hi>W. P's.</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and paſs over thoſe points, which pincht him moſt, and what he found too hard for him to anſwer, under the Title of little Cavills and poor Evaſions, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in themſelves; 'tis more then probable the Bp. will come under this Cenſure, and that this unuſual way of dealing with an Opponent, will be accounted (by fair Diſputants) but a poor Evaſion in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, eſpecially if it be remembred, how the Bp. hath already given us an inſtance of the like kind, in paſſing over three or four pages of <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> (in which <hi>W. P.</hi> enumerated ſeveral inſtances, and charged the Bp. with unfair and abuſive dealing by us) with ſaying only, <hi>to omit things leſs</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:173010:31"/> 
               <hi>material;</hi> See (. <hi>p.</hi> 9.) Thus, Reader, having given thee this item we deſire thy ſerious peruſal of <hi>W. P's. Defence,</hi> with the Bp's. <hi>Reply,</hi> and thy Judgment is free, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo great a part of that Book, which lyes unanſwered by the Bp's. taking ſuch a compendious way, is ſo poor, little, and contemptible as the Bp. would make it. We now come to conſider the ſeveral heads or figures of Speech, the Bp. in his way has reduced <hi>W. P's.</hi> Arguments to.</p>
            <p>Ibid. (7.) <hi>Manifeſt Impieties</hi> (ſaith the Bp.) are, 1ſt. <hi>His falſifying the Sence of Scripture, and then the words of it ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he cannot well ſeem inſenſible of it himſelf; thus, Whereas our Lord ſaid,</hi> John 3. 20. <hi>Every one that doth evill hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved: (which paſſage to make look favourable to his purpoſe) he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the</hi> 21. Verſ. <hi>And reads it thus, He that Loves the Light, brings his deeds to the Light, to ſee if they are wrought in God: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the plain meaning of the Text is no more, then they that do evill, ſeek to be hid</hi> (1 Theſ. 5. 7. <hi>They that are drunken, are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Night) they who do well fear not to bee ſeen; to which Senſe every Nation hath Proverbs.—With us Truth ſeeks no corners, with many more like.</hi> Thus the Bp.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:173010:32"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To falſifie the ſence of Scripture knowingly and with deſign, is no doubt great Impiety; but for the Bp. to tax <hi>W. P.</hi> as he hath done in the preſent Caſe, is very Uncharitable, if not Worſe.</p>
            <p>Now the Impiety, Falſifying, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, (which the Bp. would Unjuſtly ſaſten upon <hi>W. P.)</hi> conſiſts only in ſaying <hi>Loves the Light,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>doth Truth:</hi> Pray, Reader, turn to <hi>W. P' s. Defence (p.</hi> 115.) and there thou wilt find <hi>W. P's.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to ſhew, that the Light of Chriſt was to be judg of the deeds of Men, which theſe two Texts do plainly prove from Chriſt's own Words. Now let us ſee what <hi>W. P.</hi> could gain by this alteration, which muſt be his end, if true as the Bp. ſays <hi>(to make look favourable to his purpoſe) W. P.</hi> ſays, <hi>Loves the Light,</hi> and the Scriptures, <hi>doth Truth;</hi> Now <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. ſays, <hi>every one that doth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved:</hi> Surely then he that brings his deeds to the Light (as the doer of Truth did) muſt certainly be a lover of the Light; So then he that doth truth <hi>loves the Light,</hi> and he that loves the Light <hi>doth Truth,</hi> where then is the falſifying the ſenſe of Scripture; Nay rather, if there be any difference, (we think) <hi>W. P.</hi> had the diſadvantage, for tho' they do not differ in ſenſe, yet, we think, the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:173010:32"/> words <hi>[Doth Truth]</hi> would rather have been more Emphetical in that place then the words <hi>[Loves the Light;]</hi> Certainly had the Bp. been ſuch a Reader, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> he would not, for this difference, have made <hi>W. P.</hi> guilty of falſifying the ſenſe of Scripture, and to aggravate the matter, adds impiety and corruption; but on the other hand rather have concluded, that either the Tranſcriber miſt, or <hi>W. P's.</hi> mind ran with the ſenſe, and conſequence of the foregoing <hi>Verſe,</hi> which we believe was the Bp's. own caſe, in his <hi>Reply,</hi> where in <hi>(p.</hi> 17.) he ſays <hi>Matt.</hi> 4. 11. which ſhould be <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 11. Again <hi>(p.</hi> 22.) he cites, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and ſo proceeds upon ſeveral verſes from that Chapter when we believe he intended 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 2.</p>
            <p>But did the Bp. conſider while he thus vilifyed <hi>W. P.</hi> for the variation of ſome words, which no way altered the ſenſe, that his high charge of Impiety would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend farther and ſtrike higher then he was aware of, or we believe would be willing it ſhould; for not only <hi>Moſes</hi> in writing the Decalogue in <hi>Deu.</hi> 5. varies from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, wherein 'twas delivered in <hi>Exod.</hi> the 20. but the Apoſtles often, yea and our Lord himſelf in reciting places of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173010:33"/> Scriptures out of the old Teſtament vary in our common Tranſlations from the verbal expreſſions of the Scriptures they recite, and give the Senſe in other words. Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Inſtances could be given, which for brevity we omit, and will mention but one, and refer to a few more: (thus), <hi>Have ye never read</hi> (ſaith Chriſt in <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 16.) <hi>Out of the mouth of Babes and ſucklings thou haſt perfected praiſe;</hi> which words are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Margine to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings haſt thou ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrength.</hi> Then <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. compared with <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. Again, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 14, 15. compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. Again <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. verſ. 11. compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16. Not to ſpend more time we refer the Reader to the Scriptures, where he will find, a multitude of Texts which in our Engliſh Tranſlation vary in expreſs words, but agree in ſenſe. If theſe Inſtances do not convince the Bp. they may a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Reader, that in taxing <hi>W. P.</hi> with manifeſt Impiety for giving ſome words of that Text <hi>John</hi> 3. 21. in other words then the Tranſlation has it, while the Senſe was no way altered; he hath therein manifeſted his great uncharitablneſs and diſingenuity. But before we end we muſt tell the Bp. if <hi>W. P.</hi> was guilty of falſifying the ſenſe of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173010:33"/> Scripture (which we do not allow) he is much more in putting ſuch groſs and carnal meanings upon the words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. 20, 21. for whereas Chriſt doth there make the Light the judg and tryer of good and bad deeds, in manifeſting the good and reproving the bad, which no other Light can do but the light of his own Spirit; and which appears plainly from the Context, ſee the foregoing 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Verſes</hi> Which light lighteth every Man and ſhines in the heart, according to <hi>John</hi> 1. 4. 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Contrarily the Bp. will have the meaning of theſe two Texts like unto proverbial ſayings and therewith compares, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 7. But what if this Text were allowed a proverbial Speech, what would this do for the Bp. as it would not be a parallel to <hi>John</hi> 3. 20, 21. ſo neither do we think 'twill anſwer the Bp's. turn, while 'tis plain the 5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> compared with <hi>Theſ. Verſ.</hi> 7. makes it a Spiritual Night, and the Bp. oppoſes, <hi>John</hi> 3. 20, 21. to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light, if we underſtand his meaning, by comparing thoſe Texts to proverbial ſayings. But the Bp. has made a great noiſe of <hi>W. P's.</hi> falſifying the ſenſe of the Scripture about thoſe two Texts (when we think 'tis plain, it lies at his own door) and yet at the ſame time paſſeth over ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scripture Texts advanced by <hi>W. P.</hi> in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:173010:34"/> that ſame place, to prove that this divine Light or Illumination of the holy Spirit is a rule to believing Chriſtians, and that it, with the holy Scriptures, is the double and agreeing Record of true Religion, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly cites <hi>John</hi> 14. 15, 16. Chap. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. 16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 20, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 8. all which Scriptures the Bp. paſſeth over in ſilence as he doth <hi>W. P.</hi> telling him thoſe words, <hi>John</hi> 3. 20, 21. were ſpoken by Chriſt before the New Teſtament was in being, and therefore a rule and judg of the Life and Deeds of Men. And tho' <hi>W. P.</hi> by way of Interrogation doth thereupon ask, <hi>What ſays the Bp. to this?</hi> Yet no anſwer from the Bp. about their being ſo ſpoken, but at the ſame time taxes <hi>W. P.</hi> with falſifying the ſenſe of <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. a Text not there mentioned by <hi>W. P.</hi> nor doth the Bp. refer us to any other place where we ſhall find it. Thus, Reader, ſee the Bp's continued unfair dealing, and to this we may add another inſtance of like nature out of <hi>W. P's. Defence (p.</hi> 52.) where he tells us the Bp. (did to himſelf in <hi>Cork)</hi> read, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. otherwiſe then it is rendered in our verſions, and that all the Tranſlators, Criticks and Comentators render that verſe about the Light as we do, except the followers of <hi>Socinus:</hi> Yet the Bp. paſſeth it over in Silence.—But no more
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:173010:34"/> of this now; we proceed to the Bp's. ſecond head of Impiety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(P.</hi> 8.) <hi>Says the Bp. his (meaning</hi> W. P's.) <hi>reproaching the holy Spirit in the Apoſtles as to what they taught.—Thus when he had no other way to anſwer the Bp's. Arguments for the Divine Authority of Baptiſm by water, taken from</hi> Acts 10. 47, 48. <hi>he ſays plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in all which</hi> Peter <hi>ſeems more concerned to ſave his own Credit, then to recommend or eſtabliſh Water Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reader, <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> We refer thee to <hi>W. P's. Defence,</hi> and there ſee in 17. pages from 75. to 92. whether he hath no other way to anſwer the Bp. about the Divine Authority of Water Baptiſm; and whether on the other hand the Bp. hath not ſaid very little to all the Arguments <hi>W. P.</hi> hath there advanced againſt it. And <hi>(2ly.)</hi> ſee where <hi>W. P.</hi> doth reproach the holy Spirit in the Apoſtles, for we deny it and ſay it is a falſe charge as well as a very unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſuggeſtion: for by the ſame rule the Bp. may as well ſay, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the holy Spirit in <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe he blamed him thus, Gal. 2. 11. <hi>But when Peter was come to Antioch I withſtood him to the face, becauſe he was to be blamed. Nay in the</hi> 13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> terms it <hi>diſſimulation. Paul</hi> here only blames <hi>Peter</hi> and not the holy Spirit, in a caſe where 'twas plain he was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:173010:35"/> willing to ſave his Credit, we mean his Chriſtian Credit, and Reputation as an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</hi> And as to <hi>W. P.</hi> he is ſo far from reproaching the holy Spirit, or blaming of <hi>Peter,</hi> that he only ſaith, <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems more concerned to ſave his own Credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then to recommend or eſtabliſh Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. <hi>W. P.</hi> by the words <hi>[own credit]</hi> intended <hi>Peter's Chriſtian</hi> Reputation and Credit as an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and Miniſter of Chriſt, which he behoved to ſave as much as in him lay, without offending the Jewiſh Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots on the one hand, or the Converted Gentiles, on the other: And thus we find <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did, <hi>Acts.</hi> 21. while he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went legal (but aboliſhed) Purifications by perſwaſion of others; and becauſe the Jewiſh Zealot's might not take offence at him and his Doctrine, and ſo ſlight or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his Miniſtry. Thus <hi>W. P.</hi> in. <hi>(p.</hi> 90.) diſcourſes about <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhewing that the reaſon of <hi>Peter's</hi> ſaying, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47, 48. <hi>can any Man forbid water,</hi> was the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Country mens Spirits, leſt his latitude to the Gentiles might diſtaſt them; But the Bp. according to his uſual way of leaving and taking what he pleaſed in his compendious way, has pict out what he hoped to make ſome advantage of againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> Therefore, kind Reader, be pleaſed to ſee that page at large, where it will very
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:173010:35"/> plainly appear, <hi>W. P.</hi> intended no other, then that <hi>Peter</hi> ſeemed more concerned to ſave his Credit as an Apoſtle and Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, then to recommend or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Water Baptiſm (as people do in our days); while 'tis plain from <hi>Peter's</hi> own words afterwards, that he excludes it from having any part in Man's Salvation, by ſaying this, 1 Pet. 3. 21. <hi>The like figure whereunto even Baptiſm doth now alſo ſave us, not the putting away the filth of the fleſh,</hi> [which Elementary Water only doth] <hi>But the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God,</hi> &amp;c. Now, Reader, judg whether <hi>Peter,</hi> or the holy Spirit in him, doth hereby teach, recommend or eſtabliſh, a divine Authority for Water Baptiſm, as the Bp. ſuggeſts. The Bp. ends this Paragraph thus; <hi>Theſe for a taſte, ſingle inſtances under each head muſt ſuffice:</hi> And ſay we they are a taſte, but 'tis of the Bp's. great unfairneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent <hi>W. P.</hi> wrong (rather then of <hi>W P's.</hi> impiety) of which we have had many taſts before, beſides more that follows.</p>
            <p>The Bp. goes on, <hi>P.</hi> 8. thus, <hi>Manifold arts of uncharitableneſs and diſingenuity, the Bp. accounts theſe that follow;</hi> (1ſt.) <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and Spiteful Inſinuations, that he, the Bp. believes not the Thirty nine Arlicles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A high charge for an imaginary crime, and whether <hi>W. P.</hi> be guilty or not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:173010:36"/> let the Reader judg by what follows: <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Defence (p.</hi> 33.) there aſſerts, That no Text in all the Scripture is ſo full and plain to prove the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> as 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 7. which the Bp. had faulted with ſhortneſs; in anſwer to which <hi>W. P.</hi> ſays conditionaly thus. <hi>[I think is a bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt if he believes the Thirty Nine Articles.]</hi> This, Reader, is the ground of that high Charge of Spight and Calumny.</p>
            <p>Again the Bp's <hi>Falſe Imputations; he down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right charges the Bp. with Levity and Scorn, as to the Language, Thee and Thou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Bp's. <hi>Teſtimony</hi> as to the point runs thus. <hi>Would it not make a mans ſtomach turn,</hi> &amp;c. We ask what is this leſs then Levity and Scorn thus to treat a People (eſpecially without diſtinction) that are conſcientious in uſing the Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to a ſingle perſon, and for which many of them have been great ſufferers; but as to the uſe of that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>W. P.</hi> hath defended it by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are unanſwered by the Bp. in his <hi>Reply,</hi> tho' he has again made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which in their place we ſhall take notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 9. The Bp. ſpends moſtly to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf, and charging <hi>W. P.</hi> with falſe Imputations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For <hi>W. P's.</hi> ſaying the Bp. in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> judged and cenſured
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:173010:36"/> the Quakers, which tho' the Bp. ſtill denies, yet that he ſo did, and that <hi>W. P's.</hi> charge was true. Obſerve Reader what follows: Thus in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> he tells us, <hi>We are ſhort and defective in that Confeſſion,</hi> viz. (Goſpel Truths) <hi>to denominate us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, makes us deluded,</hi> by judging of us <hi>under ſtrong deluſions;</hi> then with relation to our belief of the Light of Chriſt within (ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated in holy Scripture) he ſaith thus, <hi>For any perſons to yield themſelves to ſuch conduct, (beſides or againſt holy Scripture) is plainly to abandon themſelves to the deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil.</hi> Again ſaith the Bp. <hi>As you will anſwer all your ſecret arts and high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:173010:37"/> us in his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> at a great rate about our ſecret and wily ways of getting wealth, and has endeavoured to confirm the ſame now in his <hi>Reply,</hi> as above cited, which we brought together to the end we might not be troubled with anſwering in ſeveral places to one and the ſame Charge: Now to this (to uſe the Bp's. own Phraſe) <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous, Unchriſtian,</hi> and general charge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof. We anſwer, As it is far from <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,</hi> (which he applys to the title of his <hi>Reply)</hi> ſo it is alſo a contradiction to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> where he told us thus, <hi>I look upon many of you as an honeſt and well meaning people.</hi> Now to be ſure ſuch ſecret and wily ways of getting, &amp;c. as he hath charged upon us in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> and now again in his <hi>Reply,</hi> with minding it to ſuch a degree as to neglect prayer to God, &amp;c. is inconſiſtant with harmleſſneſs, well meaning, and honeſty: To be ſhort upon this point; we appeal from the Bp. our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judg, to our impartial Neighbours, who know and are better acquainted with out way of dealing then he; And now may we not with much more reaſon, return his charge of worldlineſs upon himſelf, and that not without proof, as he has done by us: what elſe made him leave his old Biſhoprick and Friends of <hi>Cork</hi> for a new one, and ſtrangers in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was it not becauſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173010:38"/> the latter was worth ſome hundreds <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> more then the former? and could he have aſſigned ſo plain a proof as this (of our making Gain Godlineſs, as he ſuggeſts of us in his <hi>Teſtimony)</hi> he might with more reaſon, and greater juſtice, have reiterated his charge of worldlineſs upon us as he has done. But to proceed,</p>

               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (P. 9.) Says the Bp. againſt <hi>W. P's. Sly Jeers, I would have my Reader reflect on this, tho' he were as big as a Bp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reader, look <hi>W. P's. Defence:</hi> p. 33. ſecond Impreſſion, from whence the Bp. took this; there ſee <hi>W. P.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts any Reader (tho in as great a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as a Bp.) to reflect upon that great and Eſſential Truth of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> but with what Candour could the Bp. make this a fault in <hi>W. P,</hi> and at the ſame time be guilty of much greater himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> plain and open Jeering, ſuch as calling <hi>W. P. King of Penſilvania,</hi> inſinuating him in the number of <hi>great men of Sin,</hi> reproaching and jeering him with a ſpirit of diſcerning in a caſe that related to matter of fact, and proveable as we have before obſerved: But the Bp. adds, <hi>No Bp. in theſe three Kindoms has the big and Scornful look and deportment of Mr.</hi> P. <hi>eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he is in the humour of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is this to ſuſpend Cenſure, here is a harſh charge, and as he has not, ſo he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:173010:38"/> will never be able to prove it: As, <hi>1ſt.</hi> we queſtion whether the Bp. was ever in <hi>W. P's.</hi> company above two or three times, and if his prejudice to him made him think he had ſo big and ſcornful a look and deportment, (which thoſe who have converſed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him never ſaw) Yet <hi>(2ly.)</hi> it is very improbable he ever ſaw all the Bp's. in theſe three Kingdoms: But ſuppoſing he did, we are ſure 'tis as impoſſible as unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he could be ſure none of them had ſo big a look, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>W. P.</hi> ſince he could not be always with them, and conſequently not know, how big, &amp;c. they looked at abſent times, eſpecially when they were <hi>in the Humour of it.—</hi>But to go on to more Jeers, (as the Bp. terms them of <hi>W. P.)</hi> ſays the Bp. of <hi>W. P.</hi> the <hi>Bp's hell.—He keeps the true hell to himſelf (God deliver Mr.</hi> P. <hi>from it?)</hi> So ſay we of the Bp. and to be ſure <hi>W. P.</hi> too? But with what reaſon could the Bp. make this a Jeer look, Reader, in <hi>W. P's. Defence? p.</hi> 44. where <hi>W. P.</hi> enumerates after the Bp's. <hi>Teſtimony</hi> what <hi>Goſpel Truths</hi> could mean of Hell, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the <hi>Grave,</hi> a place of Temporal Puniſhment after this life, or a ſtate <hi>of total Deſtruction, &amp;c.—</hi>whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>W. P.</hi> argues thus, <q>What if we mean none of theſe, may we not be in the right for all that? for what if none of theſe are
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:173010:39"/> the antient common and Scripture belief, what will the Bp. do then? one would think one of them is the Bp's Hell, and either one of theſe is an Article of his Belief, or elſe he keeps the true hell to himſelf, and was not ſo juſt as to include that in the queſtion with the reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We have been the larger in this quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſhew how ready the Bp. is to take an advantage againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> when he had really none. 'Tis plain <hi>W. P.</hi> meant <hi>(By the Bp's hell,)</hi> that Notion which he received and holds of it; and by the words <hi>(keeps the true Hell to himſelf,)</hi> he with-holds and keeps back his own Notion and Opinion of the True hell, and does not expreſs it a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong the other Notions he gave of it, ſo keeps it <hi>to himſelf,</hi> not <hi>for himſelf.—</hi>But the Bp. goes on:</p>
            <p>P: 10:) <hi>How could the Bp. more clearly have expreſt Hell, then by the eternity of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Term there uſed by the Bp. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined by Mr:</hi> P. <hi>and his brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Remember, Reader, the Bp. would not allow <hi>W. P's.</hi> implication of Faith for a profeſſion of Faith, tho' he'll take it himſelf; 'tis true he mentions everlaſting puniſhment of wicked men, but 'tis by way of Objection againſt <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> and not laid down by the Bp. as an Article of Faith; But how has <hi>W. P.</hi> and his Brethren declined that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173010:39"/> term, while they acknowledg Everlaſting Rewards to thoſe who fear God, and that thoſe who feared him not ſhould be turned into <hi>Hell?</hi> which doth imply Eternity of Torments, according to the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, and received opinion of moſt Chriſtians, as well as our ſelves: But we muſt needs ſay, we could much eaſier paſs by this Objection in another, then in the Bp. becauſe <hi>W. P.</hi> has owned Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments in expreſs words in <hi>the Riſe and Progreſs of the Quakers.</hi> (P. 38.) as we have before obſerved (which Book the Bp. had ſo lately in his pocket:) But we think the reaſon is plain, for want of occaſion he will rather make then want one againſt the Quakers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (P: 10) The Bp. charges <hi>W. P.</hi> with <hi>wilfuly falſe conſtructions of and overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bp's. Senſe, Tergiverſations, ſhifting, pittiful Evaſions; for inſtance, the Bp. had ſaid they do not in their Paper own the Son of God to be ſo much as Jeſus (the great Saviour who delivereth from the wrath to come) or the Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> (But ſays the Bp.) Mr. P. <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, they ſeveral times call him Chriſt and admires at the Bp's. palpable miſtake; (and goes on) does</hi> W. P. <hi>then know no difference between Chriſt, and the Chriſt, betwixt calling a Perſon by his Name, and acknowledging his Authority, Office and Benefits?</hi> Thus the Bp.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:173010:40"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe <hi>W. P.</hi> had only named him Chriſt, the Bp. may know, if he doth not already, that Chriſt is not ſtrictly a proper name, but an apellative; it denotes <hi>the Anointed,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and applicable to none beſides Chriſt, a name not given him by his kindred or the Jews, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 35. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 41. <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. 26. 46. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 25. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 26. 27, 31, 41, 42. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 34. In theſe with many other places of Scripture, 'twil plainly appear, that it would be incongruous to underſtand the name Chriſt otherwiſe then as an apellative, deciphering his Office and Qualification, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>promiſed Meſſiah;</hi> and not a proper name, which Jeſus was, and common to him with others, but none was Chriſt but himſelf, ſo that the very naming the Word Chriſt implies the anointed Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the Meſſiah that was promiſed and came from God. But farther, What can be more unfair and trifling then this of the Bp. thus to charge <hi>W. P.</hi> For firſt <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> beſides calling him Chriſt no leſs then Nine times, doth own ſeveral of Chriſts Offices proper only to the Chriſt. (If there were any room, as there is not for the Bp. to ſuggeſt <hi>W. P.</hi> could poſſibly mean any other then the Chriſt of God) and particularly, beſides others, that he is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:173010:40"/> the <hi>Propitiation</hi> for the remiſſion of Sins, and Juſtifyer from the guilt of Sin: and beſides, that Paper hath ſeveral references to Scriptures <hi>concerning the Chriſt.</hi> And now as to <hi>W. P's. Defence,</hi> pray, Reader, ſee from (p. 34. to. 39.) where <hi>W. P.</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again owns <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Word made <hi>Fleſh,</hi> the <hi>beloved Son of God,</hi> the only begotten of the Father, &amp;c. And yet for all this the Bp. is ſo unfair, as to continue this Objection, and pick out words from <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> to ſuit his turn, leaving out what explains them, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his charge upon <hi>W. P.</hi> muſt fall upon himſelf, <hi>viz. pitiful ſhifting Evaſions, with willfully overlooking his Sence;</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if this be fair dealing, we are to learn what it means. But to the next,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(P.</hi> 10.) The Bp. goes on thus, <hi>Again the Bp. requires them to embrace &amp; profeſs the entire Chriſtian Faith in the points wherein he has ſhewn them defective, that is, as he proved in above two thirds of the Creed. W. P.</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>Anſwers it would have become the Bp. to have told them what he would have them believe, could the Bp. have ſpoke plainer then he does when he names the Articles of the Creed, which</hi> Mr. P. <hi>ſays he holds, therefore knows.</hi> Thus the Bp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Bp. who cry'd out againſt ſhortneſs and imperfection ought not to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173010:41"/> have been guilty thereof himſelf, for we can find no ſuch words in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> as <hi>Creed</hi> or <hi>Articles of the Creed;</hi> but perhaps he'll ſay they are implied (a thing he will not allow in <hi>W. P.)</hi> when he ſays thus in his <hi>Teſtimony, There is not One Article of our common Twelve you have owned entirely, and Eight if not more of them you have totally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed or waved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be not what the Bp. means by the Creed, we cannot find another like it to his purpoſe in all his Paper. But <hi>W. P.</hi> ſays he <hi>holds the Creed, therefore knows it,</hi> does he ſo? and the Bp's. Conſcience, (we think) muſt know <hi>W. P.</hi> and the Quakers owned Articles of Faith more largely worded then in that brief Paper, ſince he had <hi>R. B's. Apology,</hi> and <hi>the Riſe and Progreſs of the Quakers:</hi> And therefore why ſhould the Bp. cenſure, and raiſe objections to ſuch Articles. But now ſuppoſe <hi>W. P.</hi> ſhould gueſs at what the Bp. meant by <hi>the common Twelve;</hi> we ſuppoſe the Bp. will not ſay that <hi>Teſtimony</hi> was calculated only for <hi>W. P.</hi> but the Quakers in general, (as well as others); why then might not <hi>W. P.</hi> with a great deal of reaſon tell the Bp. it became him to be more explicit, ſince no doubt, many thouſands of People beſides the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did not underſtand what the Bp. meant by <hi>the common Twelve,</hi> and therefore the Bp.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:173010:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> who would almoſt unchriſtian the Quakers, for not being more expreſſive, upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Creed, ought not to have been ſo ſhort himſelf, but according to his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the Quakers, inſtead of ſaying <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Twelve,</hi> he ſhould have made the Creed into diſtinct Articles, and laid them down for us. But leaving this we proceed to the next.</p>
            <p>(Ibid. 10.) <hi>Inconſequent and trifling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,</hi> (ſays the Bp. of <hi>W.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:173010:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> which the Bp. has pickt out of the <hi>Defence,</hi> and they imply no leſs; for who was the beloved Son of God and only begotten of the Father, according to <hi>John</hi> 1. 14.

               <add>things</add> we ſhould tell him it looks like trifling for trifling's ſake, did we not find ſome of it worſe; and indeed it looks as if the Bp. would falſify the ſenſe of Scripture, rather then want proof to make <hi>W. P.</hi> guilty of trifling and inconſequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; thus he has cited <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 27. to make the Scripture ſerve his turn againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> whereas 'tis undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, what is ſaid in the ſecond <hi>Pſal.</hi> is ſpoken of Chriſt himſelf, which is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the New Teſtament in theſe words, <hi>Acts</hi> 13: 33. <hi>God hath raiſed up Jeſus again,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:173010:42"/>

But no more of this now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 10. The Bp. quotes <hi>W.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:173010:43"/> in the Bp's. Arguments, then really there is; and had we at firſt only referred the Reader to <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> for anſwer to all theſe trifling Inſtances, it would have fully anſwered them, and ſo fully too, that we muſt take <hi>W. P's.</hi> own words to anſwer the Bp. again, becauſe the Bp. hath ſo unfair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pickt out ſuch as he hoped to make ſome advantage of; and not only ſo, but in this inſtance hath put in a word of his own, and left out three of <hi>W.

               <q>He that confeſſes the word was made fleſh, confeſſes him made fleſh by God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made holy fleſh, which is found Doctrine, and agrees with <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The word was made fleſh and dwelt among us, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Now inſtead of theſe words [the <hi>Word was]</hi> the Bp. has only put in the Word <hi>[him]</hi> Again had not the Bp. ſo unfairly left out three of <hi>W.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:173010:43"/> was diſtinction enough, between Chriſt's fleſh, which was conceived by the holy Ghoſt, and all other ſinful fleſh, to ſatisfie any, who had not a mind to Cavil or trifle for triflings ſake. Now, Reader, judg in the matter; Did the Bp. deal juſtly with <hi>W.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:173010:44"/> paſt; but in regard the Bp. did not anſwer <hi>W. P's.</hi> Arguments about the Language Thee and Thou to a ſingle perſon, they remain yet in force agaiſt the Bp. And as to his Reflections on our conſcientious uſing that Language, calling it a <hi>wicked kind of weakneſs, together with an abuſe of Religion, not to be endured,</hi> expreſſions (highly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of ſcorn and contempt) we paſs by as the effect of too much warmth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 11. The Bp. tells us, that <hi>W. P's.</hi> Cenſures of him ſavours <hi>of nothing but the height of Spiritual pride and uncharitableneſs, as that the Bp. feels no ſhare in Chriſt the glorious light of Men, that he wants acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Spirit of God in his Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Reflection of Spiritual pride and uncharitableneſs upon <hi>W. P.</hi> we will paſs by here, and refer the Reader to what follows; to judg whether it will not thence appear true what <hi>W. P.</hi> hath ſaid of him. And <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> we begin with what the Bp. ſays of the Light within, being one of the main points (as he tells us) <hi>that threatens doing hurt in</hi> W. P's. <hi>whole Defence.</hi> And thus the Bp. begins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 11. The <hi>Bp. did ſay, and ſtands to it, he knows not what to make of the Quakers Light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſay we, <hi>W. P's.</hi> opinion of the Bp's. feeling no ſhare therein muſt be true; nor
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:173010:44"/> will his calling of it the Quakers Light ſerve his turn, ſince the Quakers never called it <hi>their Light,</hi> nor owned any <hi>Other Light</hi> then the <hi>Light of Chriſt</hi> for their guide, and which the Scriptures ſo abundantly teſtifie unto, and <hi>W. P.</hi> hath very plainly and fully ſhewn. But the Bp. goes on,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as to the True Divine Light or the holy Ghoſt convincing people, by the holy Scripture applied to Conſcience, of Sin, of Righteouſneſs and of Judgment to come, the Bp. acknowledges it and bleſſeth God for his ſhare thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As we ſaid before we never meant any other, then the true Divine Light or holy Ghoſt, which we ſay, doth inwardly convince of Sin, reproves for it and by the diſcovery of which we ſavingly come to know the things of God, and is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal agent and foundation of our conviction, and by which the holy Scriptures are made beneficial unto us: If the Bp. mean thus by the above words we agree, but if he mean (as his words ſeem to us to import) that the Scripture is the firſt Agent, and by which, as the cauſe we are convinced by the Light or Spirit, we muſt diſſent from the Bp. herein, and that the Bp's. meaning is ſuch, we are the more confirmed therein, by what he ſaith in. <hi>(p.</hi> 23.) viz. that <hi>people are now made holy by the uſe of outward means.</hi> That this Doctrine is repugnanr to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173010:45"/> Scripture we ſhall plainly ſhew in its place; we only brought it here to compare and explain what the Bp. means by the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Light and Spirit. Now to the above Argument; the Quakers do ſay, and the Scriptures do abundantly prove, that it is by the holy Light and Spirit of Chriſt within, by which as the firſt principal Cauſe and Agent we come ſavingly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and know the things of God; to which purpoſe we could cite a multitude of Scriptures, but for brevity let theſe few ſuffice; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>That which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs hath ſhined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> John 1. 4. <hi>In him</hi> (viz. Chriſt) <hi>was life and that life was the light of Men.</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>He</hi> (viz. Chriſt) <hi>was the true Light, which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> Again, 1 Cor. 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>But God hath revealed them,</hi> (viz. the things of God) <hi>unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God, even ſo the things of God knoweth no Man but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. Now we have received not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> Again, 1 John 2. 27.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:173010:45"/> 
               <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things.</hi> Again even to the wicked Phariſees, the worſt of Chriſt's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 21. <hi>Behold the Kingdom of heaven is within you.</hi> Then <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2, 11, 14, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10 Theſe Texts (beſides many more we could cite) do ſufficiently prove our point that it is by the Light and Spirit of God inwardly manifeſted, by which as the firſt and principal means we come to have a ſight of Sin and be convinced of it, and while the Bp. ſays 'tis by the uſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means people are made holy as in <hi>(p.</hi> 23.) we are (we think) by the ſame rule to underſtand he means they are to be convinced of Sin, Righteouſneſs and of Judgment; If he thus intends 'tis worthy his conſideration how contrary his Aſſertion is to the Scriptures we have cited, and whether he has that ſhare in the Divine Light and Spirit of Chriſt as he pretends to: But that we may not be miſunderſtood, as if we went about to undervalue the Holy Scriptures, far be it from us, for we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for our ſelves, and the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, that we Love, Honour, and Eſteem them above and beyond all the Books and Writings in the whole World,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:173010:46"/> and are thankful to the Lord for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, as having found great comfort and benefit by them, thro' the illumination of the holy Spirit, and believe them to be, whatſoever they ſay of themſelves according to theſe or any other Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. We ſhall not be altogether ſo full as to the Scriptures here as we might, in regard we ſhall have farther occaſion hereafter, where we ſhall be more full upon this head; Yet here may be a fit place, to anſwer the Bp's. demand <hi>(p.</hi> 13.) viz. <hi>What is become of Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>Double Record.</hi> We anſwer, here it is, the Light, Grace, and Spirit of God, by its illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion giving us the experimental knowledg of the things of God within (as we have ſhewn) <hi>is one;</hi> agreeing with and opening to us the Miſteries of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> (without) which is the <hi>other:</hi> And thus the Apoſtles made the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament an agreeing Record with the openings and the illuminations of the holy Ghoſt in them, while they cited numerous Texts and portions of Scripture out of the Old Teſtament as an agreeing record, to what they imediatly delivered by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Spirit; this (we think) is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make good <hi>W. P's.</hi> aſſertion, that the Light and holy Spirit within, and the Scriptures without, are the Double and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing Record of true Religion.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:173010:46"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>(Ibid.</hi> 11.) The Bp. goes on vilifying <hi>W. P.</hi> about the Light within, (to paſs by his twitting of him about his Learning) ſaying thus, <hi>He</hi> (i. e. the Bp. himſelf) <hi>had made four the moſt rational conſtructions and conjectures he could deviſe of what they</hi> (the Quakers) <hi>ſhould mean thereby</hi> (p. 12.) <hi>Mr.</hi> P. <hi>rejects all with ſcorn and vile inſinuations.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reader, be pleaſed to ſee <hi>W. P's.</hi> Defence from <hi>p.</hi> 52. to 65. and whether what the Bp. ſaith be true or not. And ſince the Bp. hath not anſwered <hi>W. P's.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, but with reproachful words, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through and overlooking moſt of the many Scripture proofs brought by <hi>W. P.</hi> to demonſtrate what he and the Quakers meant by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt within. We ſay ſince the Bp. hath ſo done, both <hi>W. P's.</hi> Arguments and ſuch Scripture proofs lye at his door, together with thoſe we have added as a farther proof and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of what we mean by the Light and Spirit of Chriſt within, (not here to mention our own experience of the virtue and efficacy thereof with the Bleſſed Effects which to the Glory and Praiſe of God, we have found thereby) ſo that if after all that has been ſaid, the Bp. ſhall ſtill declare his ignorance of what the Quakers mean, by the Light within, 'tis but too evident a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:173010:47"/> proof of the little ſhare he has in or acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(P.</hi> 12. 13.) The Bp. brings in <hi>R. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> for a ſhare, reproaching him alſo with Banter and Cant about the <hi>Light within;</hi> in reading which we could not without noted obſervation remember how ignorant the Bp. made himſelf in his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> concerning the Quakers Principles, and how ready he was to charge, and almoſt unchriſtian them for the brevity of <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had <hi>R. B's. Apology</hi> which fully handled ſome of thoſe very points, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make a new diſcovery of, and condemned in that Paper, as being ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt: Yet now from the ſame Book, he can nicely pick words here and there, ſome of them many pages diſtant and put them together, in expectation (by abuſing <hi>R. B's.</hi> ſenſe and making falſe conſtructions) to ſerve his turn againſt the Quakers.</p>
            <p>He tells us <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>No rational Man alive can make ſenſe of what he</hi> [R. B.] <hi>has writ thereon</hi> (i. e. Light within.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Bp. is here a great undertaker whilſt <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> 'tis impoſſible for him to be ſure, all the rational Men alive, who have (or may read) <hi>R. B's. Apology</hi> on that ſubject, are of the ſame mind with him. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> We tell him, another Mans affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative may be as good as his negative; and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:173010:47"/> not to mention the moſt rational Men, there are as rational Men as the Bp. (not to leſſen him) who can make ſenſe of what <hi>R. B.</hi> has writ. But we the leſs wonder the Bp. ſhould not underſtand what <hi>R. B.</hi> and others have ſaid of the Light within, ſince he appears, ſo unexperienced about Spiritual matters, as to Revile <hi>R. B.</hi> with being unintelligible, and guilty of Banter, not only concerning the Light, but about Spiritual ſenſes plainly proveable by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as we ſhall anon evince; and in the mean time we ſhall conſider the Bp's. next and greateſt charge in this page againſt <hi>R. B.</hi> which is as he ſays for perverting Scripture and adding a new term (as he calls it) namely the word [Light [to the Text, <hi>John.</hi> 3. 16. that he <hi>may</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>prove Chriſt as a Light given to all.</hi> And yet at the ſame time, he picks out this word, he takes no notice of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Scriptures, which <hi>R. B.</hi> has cited to prove the ſufficiency and univerſality of the Light; only he tells us <hi>he (R. B.) miſapplies two or three Texts to prove this Light univerſal,</hi> but not a word how or wherein. But to the word [Light] 'tis ſo plain on <hi>R. B's.</hi> ſide, as having no ſuch perverting intention, that we cannot believe but the Bp's. Conſcience muſt know he wronged <hi>R. B.</hi> in this caſe as well as in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:173010:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> what follows hereafter, which we ſhall ſhew; only in the firſt place let us take the Bp. in his own way about the Light; Then ſay we, if that Text might have proved Chriſt, a Light given to all, had the word Light been there, then certainly he's proved ſuch, if we bring ſeveral Scriptures as full to the point; thus, <hi>John</hi> 1. 4. <hi>In him was life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</hi> Verſ. 9. <hi>He was</hi> (viz. Chriſt) <hi>the true Light which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> What can be more plain as to the univerſality of the Light of Chriſt. Again Chap. 8. 12. <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the Light of the World, he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the Light of Life;</hi> which Texts ſufficiently prove that <hi>Chriſt is a Light to all.</hi> And certainly the Bp. ſought for an occaſion while he pickt out that Word, to Accuſe <hi>R. B.</hi> tho' at the ſame time does not confute thoſe Scriptures with ſeveral others brought both by <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> to prove the Light of Chriſt within, unleſs by falſifying the ſenſe of thoſe Texts noted before <hi>(p.</hi> 29.) Now to the perverſion and addition charged by the Bp. upon <hi>R. B.</hi> with much noiſe, obſerve, Reader, the word [Light] is in the Theſis of <hi>R. B's.</hi> fifth Propoſition in his <hi>Apology,</hi> where he has no leſs then five Scripture Texts, and there is not any one
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:173010:48"/> of all the five laid down in the exact and full words of Scripture, ſome of them very ſhort, as well as differing in words; and in particular this very Text, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. cited by the Bp. are neither the full, nor yet all of them the exact words of that Text; Beſides the word Light, and indeed the five Texts, he there gave, were only a kind of References to Scriptures, which proved the Argument he was upon, namely the univerſality of the love of God through Chriſt Jeſus, who was the Light of the World and Light of Men: Now we'l grant, if <hi>R. B.</hi> had laid down all theſe Texts as the entire words of Scripture, and that he could not plainly prove <hi>Chriſt the Light of Men,</hi> then had he been in the wrong and the Bp. in the right; but ſince the firſt are not ſo, and that he as well as we have ſhewn by plain Scripture Chriſt to be the Light of Men, we think 'tis but too plain the Bp. wanted an occaſion, while he made this one, for in reading <hi>R. B's.</hi> Explanation and Defence of this Propoſition, where in, <hi>p.</hi> 81. We find the full and entire words of that Text laid down thus, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, that who ſo ever believed in him, ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting Life.</hi> Now, candid Reader, judg in the matter, which is moſt obvious, the Bp's. partiality
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173010:49"/> by indeavouring to miſrepreſent <hi>R. B.</hi> or <hi>R. B's.</hi> intention to pervert and add a new term to Scripture, when he had not the leaſt need of it, and had ſeveral other plain Scriptures to prove the point.</p>
            <p>The reſt of <hi>p.</hi> 12. and part of 13. is moſtly a recital of pickt words here and there taken out of <hi>R. B's. Apology,</hi> and as we ſaid before, ſome far diſtant added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, upon ſome of which, the Bp. puts his own falſe conſtructions, and yet in concluſion, we do not find he pretends to confute them by any other Arguments then by his own Aſſertion, as <hi>p.</hi> 12. he tells us <hi>by the way he does not think this Scripture Language;</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 13. avers <hi>'tis unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, that is Banter;</hi> ſo that we need take no further notice then only refer the Reader to <hi>R. B's. Apology,</hi> where (if he be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial) he will find full ſatisfaction: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in regard the Bp. doth greatly abuſe <hi>R. Bp's.</hi> ſenſe, we will take notice and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſuch his recitalls.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>(p.</hi> 12.) the Bp. cites ſome words out of <hi>R. B's.</hi> Diſcourſe on the ſixth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his <hi>Apology,</hi> where <hi>R. B.</hi> was proving that <hi>the ſeed, Light, or Grace of God</hi> is no <hi>accident,</hi> but a real <hi>Spiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> Then ſays the Bp. <hi>of their feeling it, yea anon Taſting, Smelling, ſeeing it, and handling by virtue of it the things of God,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:173010:49"/> 
               <hi>which yet</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>are certainly all Spiritual things. Again the</hi> Bp. goes on <hi>(p.</hi> 13.) <hi>that people ſhould be able to ſmell, and feel, and handle things, which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and immaterial can no ways be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to theſe Senſes, nor are ſo much as ever Metaphorically ſaid to be ſmelt, or handled; the Bp. avers unintelligible, that is Banter:</hi> Then he tells us he expects our Reply, that he is a <hi>carnally minded Man, to whom all this ſeems ſtrange,</hi> which he will anſwer <hi>anon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, the Bp. in this caſe, might as well have expected to be taxed with great <hi>unfairneſs</hi> in wilfully abuſing <hi>R. B's.</hi> ſenſe, as that he is a <hi>carnally minded Man,</hi> and that he is guilty of the firſt, and ſuch a Man in the laſt, we think nothing can well be plainer; while in the firſt he makes <hi>R. B.</hi> to alſude to outward ſenſes, whereas the Scope of his Arguments, as well as his plain Words do prove the contrary: thus, <hi>p.</hi> 95. <hi>R. B's. Apology,</hi> (and the ſame Section cited by the Bp. (which he makes, 16. but it ſhould be Sect. 14.) <q>
                  <hi>We come to have thoſe Spiritual Senſes raiſed, by which we are made capable of Taſting, Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Seeing and Handling the things of God.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>And in plain oppoſition to outward Senſes, which the Bp. would inſinuate, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſays in the next words, for a <hi>Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach unto thoſe things, by his natural</hi>

                  <hi>Spirit and Senſes as is above declared:</hi>
               </q> Pray, Reader, judg in the matter, can there be a plainer abuſe put upon a Man, while the Bp. oppoſes intellectual and immaterial things, and Spiritual Senſes, to what <hi>R. B.</hi> intended, when <hi>R. B's.</hi> plain words intends <hi>Spiritual,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Natural</hi> Senſes.</p>
            <p>Next as to the <hi>Seed, Light, and Grace of God,</hi> which the Bp. cites. <hi>p.</hi> 12. and which <hi>R. B.</hi> ſays <hi>is a real Spiritual Subſtance, which the Soul is able to feel and apprehend, from which that real inward Spiritual birth in Believers ariſes, called the New Creature, and New Man in the heart.</hi> Now for confirming <hi>R. B's.</hi> expreſſions to be ſound and Spiritual. both in this Citation, as alſo in relation to Spiritual Senſes, we ask the Bp. what New Creature the Apoſtle meant. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. And what that hidden Man of the heart was the Apoſtle ſpoke of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. And what thoſe <hi>Senſes</hi> were, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. by which the Apoſtle <hi>ſaw, felt,</hi> and <hi>handled</hi> the word of Life; Then what <hi>taſte</hi> that was <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 8. <hi>O taſte</hi> and <hi>ſee that the Lord is good;</hi> And what that ſweet <hi>ſavour</hi> was, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Sweet Smell, Cant.</hi> 4. 9, 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 13. Now, Reader, judg in the matter, might not the Bp. with much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if he had conſidered rightly, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be termed a Carnaly minded Man
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:173010:50"/> by us, while he rendered <hi>R. B.</hi> guilty of unintelligible <hi>Banter. P.</hi> 12. the Bp. tells us <hi>R. B.</hi> will have this <hi>Light or Grace the purchaſe of Chriſts Death</hi> for every Man, <hi>lightning the hearts of all in a day, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the hearts of wicked Men, even whilſt they are in their wickedneſs, which the Bp. tells us he thinks not Scripture Language.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That <hi>R. B.</hi> hath fully and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably owned and aſſerted the Attonement and Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>(p.</hi> 96.) of his <hi>Apology;</hi> as alſo in the ſeventh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition about Juſtification, we ſuppoſe the Bp. will not deny, and in the firſt doth make an eſpecial exception againſt being miſunderſtod in that point, while he was treating of the neceſſity of obeying the Light and Grace of Chriſt, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefits of his death and ſufferings for us: why then might not he ſay this Seed, Light Grace or Spirit of Chriſt, was the purchaſe of his death, ſince it came by him; ſee <hi>John</hi> 1. 17. <hi>The Law came by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes but Grace and Truth by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Again <hi>John</hi> 1. 4, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>John</hi> 16. 7. 13. And that it <hi>ſubſiſts</hi> in the Wicked, tho' in a far different manner then in the Righteous (as <hi>R.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 12. The Bp. tells us that <hi>R.

B.</hi> proves it <hi>after his way:</hi> And as to that part in <hi>(p.</hi> 13.) the Bp. has neither fairly cited it, nor told the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, for <hi>R.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:173010:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> for full ſatisfaction to all the Bp's. Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 13. The Bp. proceeds thus; <hi>By what has been produced out of</hi> R. B. <hi>in his own words, it appears Mr.</hi> Penn's <hi>double and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing Teſtimony of the Light within and the Scriptures of Truth without, is but a New bubble upon the World, a thin Leaf of Gold, to make the poiſonous Pill of their Light within go down with the leſs reluctancy or even ſus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to the Bp's. picking out, and putting falſe conſtructions upon <hi>R. B's.</hi> and <hi>W. P's.</hi> words, we have obſerved to the Reader already; Next as to the agreeing Teſtimony, we have ſpoken to that before, to which we refer.</p>
            <p>Laſtly as to his Calling the Light within a Poyſonous Pill, we hope he will not blame <hi>W. P.</hi> or any other for ſaying he has no ſhare in it, while he thus reviles it, and how far the Expreſſion may Affect the Bp. in the ſight of the Lord we Love: But to be plain, had we (who believe in the Light of Chriſt) uttered ſuch words, we ſhould have concluded our ſelves guilty of little leſs then Blaſphemy; Nor do we ſee how his ſalvo of calling it the Quakers Light will excuſe him, ſince we have always declared it to be the Light of Jeſus Chriſt, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaly given to all Men, often teſtified unto in the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:173010:52"/>
            <p> The latter end of <hi>(p.</hi> 13. and 14.) The Bp. exclaims againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> for menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning many Reformers and Martyrs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with us as to the double and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing teſtimony of the Spirit of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the Scriptures of Truth without; but ſays the Bp. <hi>without producing one word out of them or referring to any Treatiſe or Page.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Bp. had firſt confuted the Scripture Teſtimonies, <hi>W. P.</hi> laid down di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly proving the ſufficiency of the Light, Grace, and Spirit of God within, he would have had the better pretence to have har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued upon <hi>W. P.</hi> about theſe Authors; but that he did not, for a good reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, becauſe he could not. And as to thoſe Authors, if the Bp. had publiſhed his Anſwer while <hi>W. P.</hi> was in <hi>England,</hi> he might have receiv'd a fuller anſwer from himſelf then we can give, he being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (to be ſure) better read then we are. However, we queſtion not in the leaſt, but <hi>W. P.</hi> had good ground for what he aſſerted, tho' at the ſame time we think 'tis plain, he laid no ſuch great ſtreſs upon their Authority, ſeing he referred not to particular Treatiſe or Page; and what need for it, ſince he quoted Chapter and Verſe, of an undeniable authority, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But why is the Bp. ſo loud againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> for what he is ſo guilty of himſelf,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173010:52"/> he tells us, <hi>That</hi> Luther, Melancthon, Zuinglius, and Calvin, <hi>as well as other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and Reformed, generally hold among other points Three, that are expreſly contrary to what the Quakers teach of the Light within;</hi> And ſo goes on to tell us, what thoſe Three points are, and after all not one word in what Book, Treatiſe, or Page, we ſhould find any one of them: Now is it not ſtrange the Bp. ſhould ſo inconſiderately fall into the ſame Errour, he but juſt before charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>W. P.</hi> or muſt it be a Fault in <hi>W. P.</hi> and none in the Bp.</p>
            <p>But the Bp. tells us <hi>he fairly avers it and takes upon him to prove it if Mr.</hi> P. <hi>or his Abetters ſhall deny it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If he does it no better, then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things we have noted him, not only ſhort but unfair in before, we have but too much cauſe to believe his proofs will be very lame: But to end this Diſpute and come nearer home, let the Bp. but fairly refute the many Scripture Teſtimonies quoted by <hi>R. B. W. P.</hi> and ſome by us to prove the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Light, Grace, and Spirit of God within Man, given as a ſure Guide and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to him, and he will do the work fully without either troubling the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers or Martyrs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(P.</hi> 15.) The Bp. goes on thus; <hi>If they</hi> (i. e. the Quakers) <hi>ſhall ſay, the</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:173010:53"/> 
               <hi>Bp. wrongs them in ſaying, they make their Light within the rule of their actions at any time, without or againſt holy Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what may be produced out of their Books, by way of Doctrine, and particularly</hi> W. P. <hi>(p.</hi> 105.) <hi>let them anſwer among others to theſe two matters of fact.—One</hi> Knight <hi>on a certain Lords day, in the time of Divine worſhip, came into the Congregation.—And ſtood there ſtark naked.—Crying out, behold here the naked Truth.—Again one</hi> Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>in the town of</hi> Roſs.<hi>—Gave out for a miracle he would faſt—Forty days; But tho' he gave off, before the Forty Days were near at an end, Yet it was diſcovered, that in a Rick of Beans near his Chamber, he had made a great hole, and devoured a ſuitable quantity of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. (1ſt.)</hi> As to <hi>W. P's.</hi> Doctrine <hi>(p.</hi> 105.) If falſe Doctrine, why does not the Bp. confute it, he tells us in <hi>(p.</hi> 2.) he ought not to connive, but why then doth he do it here, and not only here but before, for this is the place we complained of before, wherein he made a great Out-cry againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> for falſifying the Senſe of the Scripture. <hi>John</hi> 3. 21. about the Light, And at the ſame time was wholly ſilent to the many other Scriptures which followed, and which <hi>W. P.</hi> brought to prove the Light and Spirit of God within Men: Doth the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:173010:53"/> Bp. think to come off thus by calling it falſe Doctrine, without proving it ſuch, we think 'twill hardly paſs, unleſs with very credulous Readers. Surely if the Bp. had well conſidered what he ſaid or well obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what the holy Scripture ſaith, he would ſcarce have quoted that page for falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine above any other in that Book, great part of it being Texts of Scripture, ſo full to the point he had in hand that hardly any thing can be more plain: Reader ſee 105. firſt, and 115, 116, pages ſecond Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> As to the Story of <hi>Knight</hi> the Inſtance of which looks as if the Bp. would go far, rather than want matter to defame the Quakers withall (it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 26 Years Old) we hardly ſuppoſe the Bp. gives this ſtory of <hi>Knight</hi>'s nor yet <hi>Workman</hi>'s from his own certain knowledge; if from report, (as we underſtand he doth) would it look well in a Quaker to take a ſtory out of the <hi>Cobler of Gloſter</hi> concerning a Prieſt or Bp. and ſpread it as the Bp. hath done, let him conſider of it. As to the Story it is not true in all its parts (as laid down by the Bp.) according to our beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, for we have made full enquiry into the matter, and do find, that altho' he did go, and ſtand naked before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, yet that he never ſaid theſe words <hi>(behold here the naked Truth)</hi> for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:173010:54"/> the Bp. may aſſure himſelf, had <hi>Knight</hi> ſpoke ſuch words, the Quakers would have been as ready to diſown him with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſuch Expreſſions, as the Bp. is to Aſperſe the Quakers with the Story; and how ready he is at that, we leave the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to judg: But as to <hi>John Knight</hi> (for ſo was his name) the Man is dead, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer for himſelf, but his Widow gives the relation of the words he ſpoke, as he gave them to her, which are theſe: <hi>[As odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as I ſeem in your eyes, ſo odious are your actions in the ſight of the Lord.]</hi> And how odious the Actions of that Congregation was in the ſight of the Lord, the Lord beſt knows; And as to <hi>Knight</hi>'s call to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, we ſhall leave it to the Lord; But this we can ſay, we never knew or heard otherwiſe, but that he was a very ſober, honeſt, and Religious Man, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his end, which Character we believe, all who knew him will give of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the ſtory of <hi>John Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> according to our beſt information that ſtory, is not true as related by the Bp. the Man being alſo dead, his Widow has given a Narrative of the whole under her hand, too long to be inſerted here, but to give it in ſhort; She ſays, He never gave out at all (much leſs as a <hi>Miracle)</hi> neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to faſt any certain time, for when
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:173010:54"/> he was asked the Queſtion, by her ſelf and others, he anſwered, he could not tell how long he was to faſt, that was hid from him, the time was until he had <hi>freedom from the Lord to eat:</hi> She farther ſays, She is fully aſſured he did really faſt Thirty days, in which time he eat nothing, only at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, waſhed his Mouth with ſmall beer or water, and at times drank a little water.—Then as to the <hi>Bean Stack being near the Chamber where he lay, and that he made a great hole, and devoured a ſutable quantity of them,</hi> ſhe ſays it is utterly falſe, for there was no ſuch thing near his Chamber, and that his Haggard of Corn lay at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Houſe; But this ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that ſuch a Lie was forged by a Light Frollickſome Fellow at <hi>Roſs,</hi> who kept an Ale-houſe, and to make his Tipling Gueſts merry, raiſed this lying Story, upon that <hi>honeſt Man,</hi> for ſo we call him, and ſo he was reputed by his neighbours, and one that abhorred deceit, and lying, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his reallity in this thing is the leſs to be queſtioned, and if the Bp. can diſprove him to be ſuch, by credible witneſſes, or the Story otherwiſe, then as we have told, he may do it if he can. And ſo we proceed to the Bp's. demand.</p>

            </p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:173010:55"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We utterly deny the conſequence, and ſay the Light of Chriſt which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be led by, did never lead any either into wildneſs or immorality; but on the contrary, ſuch as follow it, are led by it into godlineſs and ſobriety, according to the agreeing record, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 9, 10. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. And if any coming among us, and pretending to be of us, are guilty of Immoral practices, we have <hi>Church Diſcipline,</hi> by which we deal with and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own ſuch as the nature of the Caſe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Then as to Doctrines and Practices upon a religious account, if any ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of the <hi>Light within</hi> broach any evil Doctrine, or act any thing repugnant to or againſt the Teſtimony of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we diſown ſuch Doctrines or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; knowing, that as every evil thing, contradicts the Scriptures, ſo it really doth the Spirit from whence the holy Scriptures came, and conſequently in reallity, they cannot oppoſe one another. Now as to thoſe two Inſtances brought by the Bp. which he demands a double record for, if he means going Naked, or Faſting, without his other untrue Circumſtances,</p>
            <p>We anſwer, tho' we neither ſay nor allow ſuch extraordinary things, as appearing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ought to be done by imitation, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of the Lords ſervants did ſo of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:173010:56"/> Old: Yet he may remember we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in holy Scripture for both. Did not the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> walk <hi>naked and bare footed,</hi> three Years as a <hi>ſigne? Iſaiah</hi> 20. 2, 3. And how was he and the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> as <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi> to the wicked, in what the Lord required of them? many Inſtances of which we could produce, but for brevity ſake we omit them. And as to <hi>Faſting,</hi> we have ſo many examples of that kind in both Old and New Teſtaments, that we think it needleſs to bring any proof for that practice. Thus having reply'd to the Bp's. demand we proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid. P.</hi> 15. The Bp. ends this Paragraph, with telling us he could have aſſigned more <hi>immoral inſtances,</hi> but has forborn: And to end this Paragraph, we muſt tell him our thoughts, which are, that if he could have gotten either more, or ſuch as he thought would have rendered the Quakers more odious, we are doubtful whether his good inclinations to the Quakers, would have been ſo prevalent on him, as to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born on that account.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:173010:56"/> Maxims, that <hi>Cunning borders upon Knavery.) In that he never produces his Authors words, and his unfaithfulneſs in repreſenting the ſenſe widely different, if not contrary to what it is;</hi> Ouzelius <hi>in his notes on</hi> Minutius Felix <hi>tells us the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians forbore the Heatheniſh cuſtoms, and particularly therefore, they rejected the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Crowning their Dead with Garlands, this Mr.</hi> P. <hi>refers to, (if he refer,) to any thing to be found in that Author.</hi> Thus the Bp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis no news for the Bp. to make much of a little, as well as much ado to no very great purpoſe againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> pray Reader ſee <hi>W. P's.

               <q>I beſeech him <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Bp.) to converſe with <hi>Ouzelius</hi> upon <hi>Minutius Felix,</hi> and he will tell him, that the firſt Chriſtians were taxed, and deſpiſed for ill bred in Manners, unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Speech, unfaſhionable in Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; in fine, Ruſticks and Clowns, as the Chriſtians ironicaly returned their Scorners the ſtile of well bred and Eloquent; this and much more he cites out of <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Theodoret and Arnobius,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is what <hi>W. P.</hi> has in that page, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as it lyes there; Now judg in the matter, Candid Reader, who is moſt guilty of cunning, and unfaithfulneſs, <hi>W. P.</hi> in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:173010:57"/> citing his Authors words as above, or the Bp. in ſaying he did not, and taking no notice or giving any anſwer, to that large Quotation. And beſides, if we miſtake not, the Bp. hath given his own Church a great wound, by the above citation out of that Author, who, as the Bp. ſays, <hi>forbore heatheniſh cuſtoms, and particularly they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, Crowning the Dead with Garlands;</hi> upon which the Bp. asks thus; <hi>Is there no difference betwixt Idolatrous Rites and the innocent Faſhions of Chriſtians ordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel?</hi> So that we think he makes <hi>Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dead with Garlands an Idolatrous Rite,</hi> as well as <hi>a heatheniſh cuſtom;</hi> upon which we ask, what ſort of Rite or Cuſtom that is in a certain Church which makes fine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands for the Dead, hanging them up in their Worſhip Houſes, with long ſtreaming Eſcutcheons? to ſay nothing of covering the Dead with them. Let the Bp. conſider the matter. But notwithſtanding, what we have ſaid, we have not yet done with the Bp. upon this head of cunning and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; we obſerve, the Bp. has made a great ado and ſpent good part of a page a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Ouzelius,</hi> &amp;c. to fix this charge upon <hi>W. P.</hi> without reaſon. Now we ask the Bp. whether he had not ſomething like <hi>cunning,</hi> in this to amuſe his Reader, while at the ſame time he skipt over ſeveral other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:173010:57"/> ſome of whoſe Treatiſes were cited by <hi>W. P.</hi> concerning the Care and Zeal, which ſome of the antients had to ſuppreſs <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> cuſtoms in Manners and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from getting in upon Chriſtians; ſee <hi>W. P. Defence, p.</hi> 71, 72. But that which is more obſervable is, that altho' <hi>W. P.</hi> brought ſeveral Scriptures, Chap. and Verſ. againſt conforming to the World, in their <hi>Faſhions, Dreſſes</hi> and <hi>Apparel,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 13, 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3. yet the Bp. takes no notice of all thoſe Scriptures (tho' they were brought by <hi>W. P.</hi> in Anſwer to the <hi>Bp's. Teſtimony,</hi> in which he put <hi>W. P.</hi> upon the Proof to ſhew the primitive Chriſtians differed from others of their Nation, and Quality in ſuch things) Now what imaginable reaſon can be given, why the Bp. ſhould make ſo much ado, (and without cauſe too) about <hi>Minutius Felix, &amp;c.</hi> while he was ſilent to all the reſt of <hi>W. P's.</hi> proofs: But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude about that of Apparel and Dreſſes we ſhall only ſay, It is much to be lamented, that ſo great an Overſeer as the Bp. ſhould (by not more publickly <hi>appearing againſt)</hi> tacitly <hi>plead for</hi> and countenance ſuch abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable <hi>pride</hi> (in Apparel and Dreſſes by calling them <hi>innocent faſhions)</hi> as is found reigning amongſt the generality of thoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtians in our day: As to what the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:173010:58"/> Bp. tells us of <hi>Octavius</hi> that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>knew one another only by their Innocence and Humility and not by any bodily mark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We <hi>Anſwer,</hi> the Bp. may know not only <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> was a ſign that <hi>Peter</hi> belonged to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but his <hi>Speech</hi> alſo, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 43.

            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 16. The Bp. goes on, <hi>and as to their language, after all artifices Mr.</hi> P. <hi>has not been able to produce (which was a preſſing point of his buſineſs) one precedent or ſhaddow of a Teſtimony that the primitive Chriſtians uſed not the ordinary Civilities in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſcourſe, and Salutations, but affected a different Style or way by themſelves; contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he might have remembered that the beloved Diſciple, being to write to a Chriſtian Siſter of Quality ſalutes her by an inſcription, To the Elect Lady.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt needs ſay we cannot but greatly admire at the Bp. thus with an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial flouriſh to aſſert againſt his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, while he wilfuly overlookt <hi>W.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:173010:58"/> greetings, and particularly in affecting to be called <hi>Rabbi;</hi> as alſo his poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to his Diſciples, againſt ſuch practices of being called <hi>Maſters.</hi> Again, <hi>W. P.</hi> Quotes Chriſts Queſtion to the Jews, viz. <hi>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only,</hi> John 5. 44. And after all this, with more, to tell us <hi>W. P.</hi> has not been <hi>able to produce one precedent or ſhadow of a Teſtimony, that the primitive Chriſtians uſed not the ordinary Civilities in their common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Salutations,</hi> is, we think as much as to tell us, that they obeyed not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, or if they did, that the Sun doth not ſhine when it appears in its greateſt Luſtre. Then as to Language.</p>
            <p>If the Bp. means <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to a ſingle perſon, we find in holy Writ all ſorts uſed it then, which if all did now, there would be no difference in that point between us and any other ſort of people: We could ſay much upon the fullſome and flattering Titles and Complements of the times, which, to be ſure, no precedent is to be found in the Scriptures for, and particularly thoſe Titles given to the Bp's. far beyond, and above, what ever was given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> or any others that we read of in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who yet were endued with the Spirit and power of God beyond what any of our
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:173010:59"/> Biſhops will pretend to: But we ſtudy brevity and will therefore be ſhort upon this Head, only before we end we muſt anſwer to the Title of the <hi>Elect Lady,</hi> who, the Bp. tells us, was a Chriſtian Siſter of Quality, but <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> a perſon of great note in the <hi>Church of England</hi> in his <hi>Annotations on the New Teſtament</hi> tells us, that direction 2 <hi>John</hi> 1. to the <hi>Elect Lady,</hi> will be beſt rendered, <hi>to the Elect Church or Congregation,</hi> ſee <hi>Wilſons Chriſtian Dictionary</hi> more largely: <hi>Verbum Lady:</hi> and if ſo as <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays, the Bp. is miſtaken in that Inſcription, to be ſure at leaſt, that <hi>he</hi> and the <hi>Bp. differ</hi> in their Opinions therein. But as to the word <hi>Lady,</hi> as it ſignifies a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is our practice ſometimes to call a <hi>Lady,</hi> the <hi>Lady ſuch an one:</hi> or a <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Lord ſuch an one;</hi> which is no more then to ſay <hi>ſuch a Lord, or ſuch a Lady, ſo called;</hi> not <hi>my Lord,</hi> nor <hi>my Lady,</hi> and ſo we end this Paragraph.</p>
            <p>The Bp's. next head <hi>p.</hi> 16, 17. is about <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> in which he does, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes (as we take it, for want of better Arguments) endeavour to miſrepreſent <hi>W. P's.</hi> ſenſe, as we ſhall plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in what follows; he begins thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Bp. ſincerely profeſſes he mourns to ſee Men ſo hardened as it appears by Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>wreſting Scripture to elude the Truth. Mr.</hi> P.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:173010:59"/> 
               <hi>firſt in a manner confeſſeth himſelf put to his ſhifts; I am ſenſible of the diſadvantage I am under,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſaith he; Yet proceeds he to ſhift on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have little cauſe to believe the Bp's. <hi>mourning</hi> is <hi>real,</hi> while he continues to abuſe, as well as miſrepreſent us, as he doth; however let his mourning be of what ſort it will, 'twas needleſs here, becauſe 'tis without ground, for we deny <hi>W. P.</hi> doth either <hi>wreſt Scripture</hi> or <hi>elude the Truth;</hi> But on the other hand 'tis very plain, the Bp. doth here wreſt <hi>W. P's.</hi> words to ſute his own turn, not only in not laying down his following words but wrongly applying thoſe he has laid down. Now <hi>W. P's.</hi> words are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>I am ſenſible of the diſadvantage I lye under, and that I touch a tender place, and what I ſay upon this Head, &amp; alſo anon upon the Supper, will be againſt wind and tide with the generality.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Reader, judg, doth <hi>W. P.</hi> in a manner confeſs himſelf put to his <hi>ſhifts,</hi> or doth he not rather expreſs himſelf thus, with reſpect to the people who are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the practice of <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>outward Supper,</hi> and conſequently therefore did believe, the harder to be prevailed upon by his Arguments, and this we take to be no more, then if the Bp. were writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts in a received Tenet of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:173010:60"/> Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> Suppoſe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> might not the Bp. with a great deal of reaſon ſay (with reſpect to them) <hi>I am ſenſible of the diſadvantage I lye under,</hi> &amp;c. would this be in a manner confeſſing he was put to his ſhifts? but we have more of the ſame kind, nay worſe in what follows: The Bp. proceeds to vindicate his allegation in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>P. 17. <hi>The Bp. had avouched thoſe words of our Lord,</hi> Matt. 28. 19. <hi>was an Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and command of Baptiſm with Water, and gave two ſubſtantial reaſons, which he holds to, Baptizing with the holy Ghoſt was not in the Apoſtles power, therefore it could not be the thing commanded them.</hi> (2ly.) <hi>Baptizing with Water was the Apoſtles and primitive practice and has been ever ſince the practice of the Church. To the firſt of theſe Mr.</hi> P. <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth; it is not true; and to make that good alledges,</hi> Acts 10. 44. <hi>while</hi> Peter <hi>yet ſpoke theſe words the holy Ghoſt fell on all thoſe that heard the word. Hence he infers, that</hi> Peter <hi>Baptized</hi> Cornelius <hi>with the holy Ghoſt: Now was there ever any thing more impertinent and inconſequent? while</hi> Peter <hi>ſpoke,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the holy Ghoſt fell on them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore (which was the point to be proved) was it</hi> Peter's <hi>act and in his power to Baptize with the holy Ghoſt? no the Spirit breatheth where it liſteth,</hi> John 5. 8. <hi>But God (ſays Mr. P.) by the</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:173010:60"/> 
               <hi>Apoſtles did Baptize Believers with the holy Ghoſt,</hi> (to which the Bp. anſwers, as we take it tacitly granting the matter, <hi>Did he ſo?) Then 'twas God Baptized them with the holy Ghoſt, and not the Apoſtles; they were only inſtruments at pleaſure, as long as the act was not principally theirs, it cannot be concluded hence to have been in their power.</hi> Thus the Bp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reader, we muſt deſire thy excuſe for this long citation, we could not well avoid it for the following reaſons; <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> Let a Man act ever ſo warily 'tis much if his words be not perverted, as the Bp. hath done by <hi>W. P.</hi> on this point. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> It will in part appear, from the Bp's. own words, (tho' to be ſure not deſignedly) how unfair he has been unto <hi>W. P.</hi> in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him, as if <hi>W. P.</hi> had ſaid, 'twas in the Apoſtles power <hi>of themſelves to Baptize</hi> with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> tho' at the ſame time in a kind of contradiction to himſelf, as a Salvo, adds; <hi>But God, ſays Mr.</hi> P. <hi>by the Apoſtles, did Baptize Believers with the holy Ghoſt;</hi> But then with a ſhort turn, Query's (as if <hi>W. P.</hi> had been of another mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>Did he ſo? Then 'twas God Baptized,</hi> &amp;c. Now, <hi>Sober Reader,</hi> we muſt deſire thy farther patience, in citing <hi>W. P's.</hi> own words, as they lye in one entire Paragraph of his <hi>Defence (p.</hi> 76.) which will not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:173010:61"/> only diſcover the Bp's. falſe repreſentation of <hi>W. P.</hi> but fully clear up the matter, that <hi>W. P.</hi> never intended or meant, 'twas barely in the Apoſtles power to <hi>Baptize</hi> with the <hi>holy Ghoſt:</hi> Thus <hi>W. P.</hi> viz. <q>I ſay then the Bp's. firſt reaſon is not true, for God by the Apoſtles did Baptize Believers with the holy Ghoſt, it fell upon them by the powerful preaching of the word; thus act. 10. 44. while <hi>Peter</hi> yet ſpake theſe words, the holy Ghoſt fell on them that heard: By which it is evident, that <hi>Peter</hi> in that Sermon was the Miniſter of the Spiritual Baptiſm, to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company.</q> 
               <hi>Now, Impartial Reader,</hi> judg in the matter, was it poſſible for a Man to ſpeak more plain, then <hi>W. P.</hi> doth here, that 'twas <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> they as his Miniſters, were made able by him to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi> Believers with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and which was <hi>W. P's.</hi> point to prove, and which he did by others, as well as this Argument, tho' the Bp. has overlookt them; and what can be ſaid or who can be ſafe? tho' ever ſo plain, while it hath been the common practice of our Adverſaries to miſrepreſent us, as the Bp. hath now done by <hi>W. P.</hi> as if he ſhould intend 'twas in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> power to <hi>Baptize</hi> with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> (ſee the Bp's. own words) But if we miſtake him not, the Bp. himſelf ſeems to allow,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:173010:61"/> that God did <hi>inſtrumentally Baptize</hi> Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> (we are ſure we intend not to wrong his Senſe, but his words to us ſeems to import no leſs,) while he ſaith, <hi>Did he ſo? Then 'twas God Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the holy Ghoſt and not the Apoſtles, they were only inſtruments at pleaſure, as long as the act was not principally theirs it cannot be concluded hence to have been in their power.</hi> Nor did <hi>W. P.</hi> ever intend 'twas in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> power, only as <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in <hi>God's hand,</hi> and by his power and at his pleaſure, they <hi>Baptized</hi> Believers with the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> but whether this was the Bp's. Intention or not we will not determine, and ſo leave it, and return to the Argument, That it is plain not only from this Inſtance cited by the Bp. but by other Arguments advanced by <hi>W. P.</hi> (which the Bp. paſt over in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) that God did <hi>Baptize</hi> Believers <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally</hi> through the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bp's. firſt reaſon falls, and <hi>W. P's.</hi> takes place. Farther, whatſoever the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> did in the diſcharge of their <hi>Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office,</hi> whether as to <hi>Preaching, Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>Baptizing,</hi> they were but <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> it was all done by <hi>God</hi> through them, <hi>God ſpake</hi> through them, yet they ſaid to <hi>ſpeak;</hi> he <hi>healed</hi> through them, yet they ſaid to <hi>heal;</hi> ſo to <hi>Baptize</hi> through them, and they ſaid to <hi>Baptize;</hi> And they were to do none
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:173010:62"/> of theſe things, till they were <hi>endued with power from on high, Luke</hi> 24. 49. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (17.) The Bp. proceeds as one put to his ſhifts indeed, (to give his own Term to <hi>W. P.</hi> when the Bp. told him, he proceeds to ſhift on) [Thus] <hi>Baptizing with the holy Ghoſt and with Fire, the words that Mr.</hi> P. <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> p. 69. <hi>and runs upon was a ſpecial Prerogative of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt's predicted only of him, Matt.</hi> 4. 11. (which ſhould be 3. 11.) <hi>and fulfilled only by him,</hi> Acts 2. <hi>not by any Man ever Living. The Bp's. firſt reaſon then is true.</hi> (ſays he)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If <hi>ſaying</hi> were <hi>proving</hi> the Bp. has done it, nor will this Argument avail him any more then the former, notwithſtanding it ſeems as if he would divide <hi>fire</hi> from the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and only allow it to be fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Indeed if he had ſaid the <hi>Cloven Tongues</hi> of <hi>fire,</hi> it had been more tollerable, but that <hi>fire</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Spiritual fire)</hi> was to accompany the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> when they were <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is very plainly prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from Scripture, as well from that Text which the Bp. has brought (to prove 'twas only fulfilled, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.) as from others. Thus, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>John</hi> Tolls many of the wicked Phariſees and Saducees which came to his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and whom he called a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers, <hi>I indeed Baptize you with</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:173010:62"/> 
               <hi>Water,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>ſhall Baptize you with the holy Ghoſt and with fire:</hi> As if he had ſaid, you, or who ever are <hi>Baptized</hi> with the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt ſhall be <hi>Baptized</hi> with the <hi>holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi> Now we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Bp. will hardly plead that all thoſe <hi>John</hi> then did ſpeak unto, were of that number, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. conſequently then <hi>Fire</hi> accompanied with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> was to extend to others as well as it did to thoſe Diſciples, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. which we ſhall farther prove: In the mean time with reſpect to the Bp's. opinion in the matter, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder at it, ſo neither do we think him a <hi>competent Judg,</hi> whether <hi>Fire</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> or not; becauſe we do not find he pretends to the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> unleſs to be obtained by outward means; however let the Bp's. opinion be what it will, we cannot but admire he ſhould affirm ſo contrary to plain Scripture (not only in the above but in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) as that the Baptiſm <hi>predicted</hi> Matt. 3, 11. <hi>was only fulfilled Acts</hi> 2. whereas if we credit the Apoſtle we ſhall find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; thus <hi>Acts.</hi> 11. 15, 16. <hi>And as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak the holy Ghoſt fell on them as on us in the begining, then remembred I the word of the Lord, how he ſaid, John indeed Baptized with Water, but ye ſhall be Baptized with the holy Ghoſt:</hi> Here <hi>Peter</hi> refers to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:173010:63"/> pouring forth of the <hi>holy Goſt,</hi> at the time of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and the marginal note in the Bible, refers to <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 4. which ſhews that <hi>Babtizing</hi> with the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> was not fulfilled by Chriſt at that time mentioned <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 4. but that it continued in the Church, and was diſpenſed through the Apoſtles miniſtry afterwards; ſo not fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by Chriſt as the Bp. ſaith. How then came the Bp. to fall into this miſtake, he will do well to conſider whether it be not for want of inward acquaintance with the Spirit, by which he would experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally have witneſſed, that <hi>Spiritual fire</hi> doth accompany the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> As to what he ſaith of the <hi>prerogative of Chriſt</hi> we aſcribe to it, as much as he can do; but then we ſay, he that <hi>had</hi> and <hi>hath</hi> all <hi>power</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 18. could and did enable the Apoſtles <hi>inſtrumentally</hi> to <hi>Baptize</hi> Believers with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> as has been ſhewn by <hi>W. P.</hi> Now as to the Bp's. Second Reaſon,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 17. That Water was the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 19. and that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles practice in <hi>Baptizing</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> was in obedience to that command; which aſſertion of his depending upon that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, we now come to conſider the ſame, by which if it appears that Water was not there commanded, it thence follows, what
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:173010:63"/> the Apoſtles did in that of Water was <hi>practice</hi> and not <hi>Inſtitution;</hi> thus the Text <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all nations Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now that we are not to underſtand <hi>Water</hi> was intended by this commiſſion appears <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> Becauſe here is not a word of <hi>Water</hi> mentioned. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt was the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſpoken to in ſhort by us and more largely proved by <hi>W. P. (3ly.)</hi> Becauſe we find the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles as <hi>inſtruments</hi> did by the <hi>power of God</hi> (not of them ſelves) <hi>Baptize</hi> Believers with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> as proved alſo by <hi>W. P.</hi> Laſtly becauſe we no where read, when the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> uſed Water in outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> they followed the terms of that Commiſſion (as they ought to have done had they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it <hi>Water)</hi> by doing it <hi>in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt;</hi> But did it <hi>in the name of the Lord, or Lord Jeſus,</hi> in which laſt form, practicers of <hi>Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> in our day would (we ſuppoſe) not think it rightly performed. Now for theſe reaſons (with others, which for brevity we omit) we have no ground at all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Water</hi> was commanded by that commiſſion; but on the contrary that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby; conſequently then what the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:173010:64"/> Apoſtles did in uſe of <hi>Water</hi> muſt be <hi>practice</hi> and not <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> as were the many <hi>legal Rites, Circumciſion, Purifications, Vows, Shavings,</hi> &amp;c. which we find they alſo practized as well as <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> even after they had received the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do not find any of the Apoſtles men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> to be any part of their miſſion, nor yet recommending the practice of it, in their Epiſtles to any of the gathered Churches in the firſt ſettlement, tho' they do far leſſer things then (ſome in our day account of) <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> and ſince they are ſilent therein, we may well conclude, that their practice in that of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was not from that command, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 19. but on the ſame foot they did thoſe other <hi>Legal</hi> things before mentioned: Nay we find that great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from believing <hi>Water Baptiſm</hi> to be any part of his commiſſion, that he not only <hi>thanks God</hi> he <hi>Baptized</hi> no more of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14. but adds in the. 17. Verſ. <hi>He was not ſent to Baptize.</hi> Again altho' he writ an Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and in <hi>Acts</hi> 20 tells them, <hi>he had not ſhuned to declare unto them all the counſell of God,</hi> Yet not a word of a Command for <hi>Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> But on the other hand ſpeaks of, and recommends in ſeveral Epiſtles the one <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſee, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:173010:64"/> 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. Thus then the Bp's. ſecond reaſon, that Water was commanded by that commiſſion falls with his firſt. Reader, be pleaſed to mind, that in what we have ſaid upon this head about <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and ſhall ſay next upon the <hi>Supper,</hi> is not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a full diſcuſſion of theſe two points, only as direct Anſwers to the Bp's. Objections, Not ſeing any need at preſent for ſuch a Treatiſe, in regard great part of <hi>W. P's.</hi> Arguments upon thoſe two heads (in thirty Pages of his <hi>Defence)</hi> lye unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the Bp. and in particular that of <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> which was a main and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing point for the Bp. to have cleared, tho' we do not find he has taken the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it in his <hi>Reply:</hi> and after all the Bp's. great talk of a divine authority for <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> 'twill be hard for him, nay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his power, either to find <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> from Scripture for what he calls <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> When <hi>Water</hi> was uſed in primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times they <hi>Repented, Believed,</hi> and were <hi>Baptized</hi> (that is <hi>dipped</hi> or <hi>plunged.)</hi> Now <hi>Infants,</hi> neither capable of good or evil are <hi>ſprinkled</hi> on the Face with a little Water, a <hi>meer humane Invention;</hi> and as we find no command or Example in Scripture for ſuch a practice, ſo neither do we know how it can be called <hi>Baptiſm</hi> at all; and as this is the Bp's. Caſe, till he had proved, or at
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:173010:65"/> leaſt vindicated his own practice by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from whence he pretends to judg the <hi>Quakers,</hi> we think he ought to have been more ſparing in his charges againſt them. Reader, if any Objections remain in thy mind, with reſpect to theſe heads of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> we refer thee to <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> and <hi>R. B's. Apology</hi> who largely treat on theſe Subjects.—And to draw towards a concluſion upon the Bp's. two Reaſons, ſince it hath appeared by <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> (notwithſtanding any thing the Bp. has urged to the contrary) that the Apoſtles did by the <hi>power of God,</hi> and as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> in his hand, <hi>Baptize</hi> Believers with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſince it doth not appear (nor can be proved) <hi>Water</hi> was intended by that commiſſion, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 19. It therefore follows, that the Bp's. two ſubſtantial Reaſons (as he calls them) falls to the ground. A little more we have from the Bp. about <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and then for the preſent ſhall have done with this head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(P.</hi> 18.) The Bp. tells us <hi>W. P. full well knows the Church of</hi> England <hi>Men no more allow Water Baptiſm to be ſufficient to the Salvation of Adult Perſons, without the New Creature, or Baptiſm of the Spirit, then he does.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. (1ſt.)</hi> If not to <hi>Adult</hi> Perſons, we Query whether the Bp. thinks <hi>Water</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:173010:65"/> 
               <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſufficient to the Salvation of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. (2ly.)</hi> Since the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is an <hi>inward</hi> work, and the <hi>means</hi> there, how doth this agree with what the Bp. ſays <hi>(p.</hi> 23.) That people are now made holy by the uſe of <hi>outward means,</hi> &amp;c. Let the Bp. reconcile theſe if he can.</p>
            <p>The Next is about the outward Supper in the uſe of <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> and the Bp. begins with citing no Page, as well as ſtepping over five Pages at once of <hi>W. P's. Defence,</hi> tho' afterwards he looks back to carp at the words <hi>[Wine from Heaven]</hi> Reader ſee the <hi>Defence. p.</hi> 92. to 107. and compare with the Bp's. <hi>Reply,</hi> how little of fifteen Pages the Bp. has anſwered, as well as the former about <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but perhaps the greateſt part, which lies unanſwered, are <hi>little Cavils and poor Evaſions</hi> with him, tho' we don't believe, they will be ſo to the Impartial Reader, This is, we confeſs, a compendious way as the Bp. told us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 18. <hi>It ſtands,</hi> (ſaith the Bp.) (viz. the Supper) <hi>upon the ſame immoveable foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with the Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Twill then follow if the Bp's. Foundation for <hi>Water Baptiſm</hi> be not ſound, as hath been ſhewn above, it is not, this of the <hi>Supper</hi> muſt be the ſame. But the Bp. proceeds with a heavy charge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> as if he were not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:173010:66"/> only guilty of a miſtake, but in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, (as he ſays) of <hi>wilful prevarication</hi> in <hi>miſreporting his words,</hi> that he might have <hi>ſomething to except againſt;</hi> for ſays the Bp. of <hi>W. P. the Bp. will have this Supper four times repeated in the New Teſtament.—</hi>Whereas the Bp. tells us his words reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>command</hi> for the <hi>Supper,</hi> and not the <hi>Supper it ſelf:</hi> and in concluſion of his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph ends with a Queſtion thus, <hi>Is there not a vaſt difference betwixt theſe two aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, This Supper was four times repeated, and the command for the Supper is four times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, which laſt was moſt evidently the Bp's. ſence?</hi> Thus the Bp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis certainly a great leſſening to the Bp. to make ſo great a noiſe, to ſo little purpoſe, from whence we conclude, that either the Bp. hoped to amuſe his Reader by being ſo Critical about a word, or elſe he was very ſhort ſighted in his Argument in rendering <hi>W. P.</hi> guilty of <hi>wilful prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> while the Bp. overlookt his plain words, as well as ſenſe, in what followed. 'Tis true <hi>W. P.</hi> mentions the <hi>Supper,</hi> as the Bp. ſaith, <hi>four times repeated,</hi> but nothing can be plainer then that he intended the <hi>command</hi> for the <hi>Supper,</hi> while immediately after he has the word <hi>command</hi> ſeveral times over, in relation to the <hi>Supper:</hi> pray Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſee his <hi>Defence (p.</hi> 97.) Now let us
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:173010:66"/> ſee, what ſomething <hi>W. P.</hi> could get againſt the Bp. by his (ſuppoſed) <hi>wilful prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> (had he intended the <hi>Supper</hi> and not the <hi>command</hi> for the <hi>Supper)</hi> ſurely ſay we nothing; nay ſo far from <hi>getting,</hi> that had he inſiſted thereon, he would have <hi>loſt</hi> his Argument thereby; for 'tho the <hi>Supper</hi> may be <hi>four times</hi> mentioned, the <hi>Command for the Supper</hi> is not four times mentioned; ſo then if <hi>W. P.</hi> had argued, that the <hi>Supper</hi> was not <hi>four times repeated,</hi> he had argued againſt himſelf. Now, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, judg in the matter, what could the Bp's. end be in ſpending a large Paragraph on this occaſion to faſten (as the Bp. ſays, in all appearance) wilful prevarication upon <hi>W. P.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having cleared <hi>W. P.</hi> from the Bp's. Charge, which was without ground, let us now ſee, whether <hi>W. P's.</hi> charge of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, will not fall upon him <hi>doubled,</hi> with good ground. The Bp. hath aſſerted in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> the <hi>command</hi> for the Supper was <hi>four times repeated</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which in that Paper runs thus, <hi>Can any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be more expreſs then This Do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me; four times repeated in the New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt tell the Bp. (as <hi>W. P.</hi> did) it muſt be his miſtake thus to aſſert, while we cannot find the <hi>command</hi> ſo <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:173010:67"/> (as the Bp. ſaith) in all the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> for, as <hi>W. P.</hi> ſaid, we muſt ſay over again, that which looks moſt like a <hi>command</hi> is in <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 19. (to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſciples) where he has thoſe words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me?</hi> the other Evangeliſts, <hi>Matthew and Mark,</hi> give only a relation of the Supper, without thoſe words, and <hi>John</hi> ſays nothing of it at all. Then as to <hi>Paul</hi> he comes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and gives the <hi>Corinthians</hi> a <hi>rehearſal</hi> thereof, upon their great <hi>abuſe</hi> of that practice, in ſuch words as do not import a <hi>command,</hi> but as often as they uſed it, they <hi>ſhewed forth the Lords Death till he came;</hi> his words cannot be called a <hi>command:</hi> But ſuppoſing (not allowing) they could, yet the Bp. muſt ſtill be at a loſs, to find the <hi>command</hi> for the <hi>Supper four times repeated</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not find them but <hi>three times</hi> expreſsly mentioned in all the Scriptures; and but one of thoſe times, can reaſonably be called a <hi>command</hi> at all; if ſo it was not <hi>repeated</hi> at all: nor will the Bp's. Argument that the <hi>command</hi> was <hi>four times repeated</hi> hold good, unleſs he prove it <hi>five times</hi> mentioned, and ſo we leave it upon the Bp. and proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 18. Says the Bp. of <hi>W. P. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to what is more dangerous</hi> (meaning
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:173010:67"/> then the prevarication) <hi>plainly to diffuſe his Poiſon, this coming of Chriſt was Spiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt needs ſay 'tis a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable expreſſion without cauſe, and if it were ſuch <hi>Poiſonous Doctrine,</hi> why did not the Bp. confute the ſubſtantial Scripture Arguments, by which <hi>W. P.</hi> proved his Aſſertion, which he ought to have done, before he uſed ſuch an expreſſion; But that the Bp. has not done, unleſs carping at words and reviling him be doing it, as will appear in what follows. And firſt he begins with reproaching <hi>W. P.</hi> for <hi>paraphraſing</hi> upon theſe Texts, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 29. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 18. where Chriſt told his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>He would drink no more of the fruit of the Vine, till he drank it new with them in the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> upon which <hi>W. P. para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſed</hi> and called <hi>Chriſt bread and Wine from Heaven.</hi> See his <hi>Defence (p.</hi> 98.) whereupon the Bp. reviles (according to his uſual way) and tells him, that <hi>he and his Brethren uſes to make, and wreſt Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>favour</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>the Scripture no where ſtileth Chriſt Wine from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we had dealt thus with the Bp. for downright perverſions and wreſting Scripture (as we have before proved) as he hath done <hi>W. P.</hi> without reaſon or ground, we muſt tell the Bp. we ſhould
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:173010:68"/> have treated him at another rate then we have done. But to the matter. Where did <hi>W. P.</hi> ſay the Scripture ſo ſaid? he only drew a natural <hi>conſequence</hi> from the words of Chriſt, and the Text it ſelf is ſo plain, that it needs no comment to prove <hi>W. P's. paraphraſe</hi> thereon: for what <hi>drink or Wine</hi> was that which was to be drank in the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but <hi>Wine from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> and who was <hi>Wine from Heaven?</hi> but Chriſt? who as he promiſed to <hi>drink with them,</hi> ſo he promiſed, <hi>Revelations,</hi> 3. 20. <hi>to Sup with thoſe that opened their hearts unto him:</hi> Now who but a Man that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matter and was willing to take occaſion to revile would Carp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Bp. did, more eſpecially, while Chriſt is called a <hi>Vine, Bread from Heaven, Water,</hi> &amp;c. with a multitude of other <hi>Metaphorical Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in Scripture, and had the Bp. been ſo well acquainted with the comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, as a truly Spiritual Man (which he pretends to be) Really is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he would never have reviled <hi>W. P.</hi> as he did on that account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 19. The Bp. goes on telling us the Apoſtles continued the uſe of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> after <hi>Chriſt was Spiritually come;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays he, <hi>this ſhewing forth his Death till he came, was not by them underſtood of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Spiritual appearance, but of his ſecond</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:173010:68"/> 
               <hi>coming to Judgment; for in that Caſe feeling ſo fully, his being come in their hearts, they would have deſiſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Altho' the Apoſtles did feel <hi>Chriſt Spiritually come into their hearts,</hi> and might alſo ſee no real <hi>Neceſſity</hi> for keeping up this practice; yet it doth not therefore follow, they would have preſently deſiſted for theſe or the Like <hi>Reaſons. 1ſt.</hi> Becauſe they might think it needful to indulge the <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>carnal minded Chriſtians</hi> among them, who wanted ſuch a ſign to keep up their minds in remembrance of <hi>Chriſts Blood,</hi> which was <hi>ſhed for them;</hi> and that ſuch <hi>weak and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal believers</hi> were among them appears plainly by the ſharp and reprehenſive expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Epiſtles writ by the Apoſtles to ſome of them; likewiſe it plainly appears by Scripture, that altho <hi>Chriſt</hi> was come in <hi>Spirit</hi> to ſome, he was not ſo come in <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to others, who yet waited for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſee <hi>James</hi> 5. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 7. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this practice might be continued among them, were it onely that we find it contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to keep up a <hi>Brotherly Fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Infancy of the Church,</hi> which appears from, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 46. <hi>and they continuing dayly with one accord in the Temple, and breaking Bread from Houſe to Houſe, did eat their meat with gladneſs, and ſingleneſs of Heart.</hi> And here we may a little compare
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:173010:69"/> the preſent practice of thoſe, who uſe this <hi>Ceremony,</hi> with thoſe in the primitive times (becauſe the Bp. has ſomething of it) Their <hi>Breaking Bread</hi> was joyned with <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Meat,</hi> quite contrary to the practice now adays, and not only in that, but other reſpects they diſagree, as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath noted. Again how widely do they differ in their opinions of the thing it ſelf, 'tis now called and believed by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to be the <hi>very Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the uſe of outward <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> ſay that the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> is in a <hi>Spiritual manner</hi> partaken of under that <hi>ſign,</hi> whereas in the primitive times, the uſe and extent thereof, as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. was <hi>in remembrance of and ſhewing forth Chriſts Death till he came,</hi> which we believe was <hi>Spiritual,</hi> in relation to that <hi>ſign. (3ly.)</hi> Why might not the Apoſtles as well conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the practice of this <hi>ſign</hi> (after <hi>Chriſt was Spiritually come in their Hearts)</hi> as in the practice of <hi>Circumciſion, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, Vows, Shavings</hi> and other <hi>legal rites;</hi> many Inſtances of which appear plain in Scripture, which we might Inſtance but ſhall be brief and tell the Reader, that what we have and ſhall write on this head is not intended for a Treatiſe thereof, only as in Anſwer to the <hi>Bp's. Objections,</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reader as before to <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:173010:69"/> and <hi>R. B's. Apology,</hi> who largely treats of this Subject. The Bp. proceeds,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 19. To invalidate <hi>W. P's.</hi> allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> were not made an <hi>Article</hi> of any of the <hi>Antient Creeds,</hi> and thereupon tells <hi>W. P.</hi> thus, <hi>he has forgot or was never Catechized as he ought to have been, or forgotten what he was taught to be the meaning of that Article, I believe the holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints; that is in ſhort</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>I believe all the faithful are made one body by communion in the ſame Faith, Covenant and Ordinances of Worſhip, eſpecially Baptiſm and the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is it not very ſtrange that the Bp. who in <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>tells Mr.</hi> P. (as he called him) <hi>as to his Paper once for all, implication of Faith is not a profeſſion of Faith,</hi> and not only ſo, but would almoſt <hi>unchriſtian</hi> us, for not being more <hi>explicit</hi> in that Paper <hi>(Goſpel Truths)</hi> ſhould now tell us by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the <hi>holy Catholick Church, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints,</hi> that the points in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on namely <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>implyed:</hi> We muſt needs tell him, and all may ſee that either he aſſumes a Latitude to himſelf by a ſtrange ſort of <hi>implication,</hi> far beyond what he will allow <hi>W. P.</hi> and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or it muſt be confeſt <hi>that Water Baptiſm and the outward Supper</hi> (and which
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:173010:70"/> we think is undeniable) are not made an Article in that Confeſſion, and conſequently his Proof falls to the ground with his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But as to the <hi>true Catholick Church, and the Communion of Saints,</hi> we can readily ſubſcribe to the Article, and do truly own the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> but deny it conſiſts in eating <hi>outward Bread and drinking outward Wine,</hi> while we ſuppoſe, the Bp. himſelf will not deny, that very <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men</hi> have partaken of the <hi>outward ſign,</hi> whereas we ſay none can truly partake of the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> but thoſe who are truly ſuch, and which conſiſts in <hi>Spiritual participation of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> according to <hi>John</hi> 6. 35. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 20. The Bp's. next Inſtance is no more to the purpoſe then the laſt he tells us <hi>in the Conſtantinopolitan Creed (compiled about the Year</hi> 379. or 380. <hi>when rebaptizing Hereticks had turmoiled the Church) 'tis expreſt, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one Catholick Church, I acknowledge one Baptiſm for the remiſſion of Sins, that is</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>perſons being once Baptized, and thereby ingrafted into the Church ought not to be Baptized again, which is the true ſenſe of one Baptiſm, and not what Mr. P. ſuggeſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Bp. who ſo much faulted <hi>W. P. p.</hi> 14. for not citing Treatiſe or Page, doth as before take the ſame liberty again
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:173010:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> in this Citation. But ſuppoſe we ſhould allow what he hath here cited, which we do not, how will the acknowledging <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> the occaſion mentioned by the Bp. prove his point? he brought this for an Antient Creed, and as ſuch we might expect his proof, that Water Baptiſm and the Supper were made an Article therein; whereas there is no word of the Supper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, nor yet implied that we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. In ſhort then this Inſtance falls with the firſt. Then as to his ſaying Perſons once Baptized, <hi>&amp;c. is the true ſence of the one Baptiſm and not what Mr.</hi> P. <hi>ſuggeſts.</hi> Pleaſe, Reader, to view <hi>W. P's. Defence, p.</hi> 85, 86. and ſee whether what <hi>W. P.</hi> ſays be his own Suggeſtions: On the contrary <hi>W. P.</hi> cites <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm; which one Baptiſm he plainly proves by ſeveral Scripture Arguments, to be the one ſaving Baptiſm of Chriſt by the holy Ghoſt: The Bp. is out if he thinks his bare Aſſertion againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> will paſs for proof, while he is ſilent to all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments advanced by <hi>W. P.</hi> The Bp. ſhould have remembred he told us, <hi>p.</hi> 18. that <hi>Water Baptiſm without the New Creature or Baptiſm of the Spirit was not ſufficient to the Salvation of adult Perſons</hi> (or words to the ſame effect) which beſpeak two Baptiſms, when the Apoſtle tells us <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. but

            <p>Now to the Bp's. third and laſt proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Antient Creeds, in which the Bp. Cites not only Treatiſe and Page but part of the Articles too, but omits the main part of all, namely the <hi>Year;</hi> we muſt tell the Bp. this will make no more to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then the former proofs; for tho' we ſhould allow the Citations true, and that they are from the poor <hi>Waldenſes</hi> (whom <hi>W. P.</hi> commends for the good Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he found in them,) Yet this Creed is too <hi>late</hi> to be accounted <hi>antient,</hi> as in the time of <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary, the firſt</hi> King of that name, according to <hi>Heylen's Coſmogr:</hi> which was in the Year 1440. and the ſecond in 1491. but whether we are right in the time or not, yet 'tis ſo late that 'tis

               <hi>rank Popery</hi> to aſſert, as the Bp. has laid it down. viz. <hi>No Man is ſaved who eats not the body of Chriſt, which body is not conſecrated but in the Church and by a Prieſt.</hi> Again, <hi>that none are ſaved unleſs Baptized, and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are ſaved by Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bp. was much in the right to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what authority <hi>W. P.</hi> would allow the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in this Creed, (ſuppoſing it theirs) To be ſure ſay we none; Nor will he allow it to be <hi>antient</hi> any more then thoſe made in the dark time of Popery, and therefore this proof alſo falls with the reſt; and if we ſhould ask the Bp. himſelf what authority he would allow the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in this Creed, will he undertake to vindicate it from point blank Popery? we ſuppoſe nay.—As to what the Bp. ſaith of <hi>Tradition,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Nations, that will come under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in what follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (20.) The Bp. frames an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon thoſe two heads, viz. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> to prove us outwardly no Chriſtians, tho' in ſo doing he muſt bring himſelf under like circumſtances in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (20.) <hi>The Bp. ſays to renounce or caſt off the outward badges of the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, which our Lord Chriſt inſtituted, and his Apoſtles delivered, and which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Churches received, and conſtantly</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Bp. in this Argument takes that for granted which we do not own, namely that <hi>outward Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> were to be continued down in the Churches, as <hi>Inſtitutions of Chriſt,</hi> as alſo that they are the <hi>outward badges</hi> of the profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which we do not allow, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary having been proved by <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Defence,</hi> and others of our Friends who have writ on that ſubject: We obſerve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the Bp. continues to clal them outward <hi>Badges,</hi> yet he omits to call them <hi>Seals,</hi> as he did in his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> which to us ſeems to be the effect of <hi>W. P's. Defence,</hi> and with more reaſon it may be attributed thereto, then the effect attributed by the Bp. to his own <hi>Paper</hi> upon <hi>W. P.</hi> as before noted.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:173010:72"/>
            <p> But to this faulty and long Argument, may not we by a parallel Argument make the Bp. and his party <hi>outwardly no Chriſtians,</hi> while they difuſe other things no leſs (if not more) poſitively commanded in holy Scripture: Thus our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the very ſame night he eat the Supper, <hi>John</hi> 13. 4. to 15. roſe from Supper and with more Ceremony waſhed his Diſciples feet ſaying, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>If I then you Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feet, ye ought alſo to waſh one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers feet.</hi> Verſ. 15. <hi>For I have given you an Example, that ye ſhould do as I have done unto you.</hi> This ſeems to us as plain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for this practice, as that for <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> and more plain then for <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe <hi>Water</hi> is not mentioned in the Commiſſion, (and this command we find was put in practice: See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10. and recommended as a virtue in a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow) nor was this only an Example of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> (true <hi>Badges</hi> of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity)</hi> but had a ſignification of an inward cleanſing as appears from the words of Chriſt upon <hi>Peter's</hi> refuſal, <hi>John</hi> 13. 8. <hi>If I waſh thee not thou haſt no part in me.</hi> Again, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 29. The Churches were expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as the mind of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> to abſtain from <hi>blood and things ſtrangled.</hi> Again the Believers were enjoined, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 14. that the ſick ſhould <hi>be anointed with Oyle</hi> in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:173010:73"/> the name of the Lord. Now from theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we form a parallel argument thus, To renounce, diſuſe, or caſt off the <hi>poſitive Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> which our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> delivered, and no doubt the primitive Chriſtians in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto <hi>practized,</hi> is to renounce and caſt off the outward profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; But the late Bp. of <hi>Cork</hi> and his party have renounced, caſt off or diſuſed the <hi>waſhing of feet,</hi> the <hi>abſtaining from blood and things ſtrangled,</hi> and the <hi>anointing the Sick with Oyl in the name of the Lord,</hi> which things our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles inſtituted and commanded.—</hi>Therefore the late <hi>Bp. of Cork</hi> and his party are <hi>outwardly</hi> no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We take this to be a plain parallel argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and by which the Bp. and his party are as much unchriſtianed as he Renders the Quakers by his, while he can find no expreſs repeal in Scripture for theſe things.—And yet at the ſame time we neither believe, he or they for the diſuſe of theſe things, nor we for the other, ought or can be unchriſtian'd, for we believe they are all ceaſed alike. If the Bp. ſay, thoſe were <hi>temporary</hi> things (with as good ground) we ſay the like of the other; If they ſay the repeal of <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>things ſtrangled</hi> are implied, where the Apoſtle tells us <hi>Coll.</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:173010:73"/> 2. 16. we are not to <hi>be judged in Meat or Drink, &amp;c.</hi> And that the Kingdom of God conſiſts not in <hi>Meat and Drink,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. We ſay the ſame of <hi>outward Bread and Wine,</hi> being <hi>Meat and Drink;</hi> In our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we have not included the conſtant practice of all Churches as the Bp. doth in his, becauſe we do not depend upon the verity of <hi>Tradition,</hi> (as the Bp. ſeems to do) altho' we underſtand that two of thoſe inſtances we have given, are ſtill practized after a manner by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence we ſuppoſe, hee'l not deny he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives the continued practice of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> tho' he declines the other: But as to the practice of Chriſtian Churches (inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Bp.) how greatly do they differ in their uſe as well as in their belief of the thing it ſelf, while there is none of all ſorts (nay not the Bp. himſelf) that follows the primitive practice, in the uſe of the <hi>outward Supper,</hi> as we have hinted before, and <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> hath more fully ſhewn; how then can we depend upon <hi>tradition?</hi> and thus we end about the <hi>Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 21. <hi>The laſt point of moment</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>in Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>Book yet remaining untoucht, is the great Difference or ground of diſſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Quakers and Eſtabliſht Church, and this Mr.</hi> P. <hi>tells us, is the great carnality and emptineſs both of Miniſters and People.</hi> Upon
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:173010:74"/> which the Bp. in return upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> goes on thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (21.)<hi>—The Bp. hereby enforced ſpeak out, he ſays then that if eating the fat and drinking the choiceſt be carnallity.—There is nothing to be eaten that is better then ordinary, that comes in to our markets here, which the People obſerve not preſently bought up by the Quakers, they are ſtill the earlieſt and beſt chapmen every Market day, for ſuch commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and much good may they do them.—</hi>And ſo concludes this as under the Title of <hi>carnallity</hi> and in the number of <hi>Scandalous Inſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Bp. in <hi>ſpeaking out</hi> had ſpoke more to the purpoſe we think he had come off with more credit, for certainly it is mean ſtuff for a Bp. to help to ſtuff his Book with all, and in an Inſtance too, that if there be <hi>Scandal</hi> in it perhaps he may be concerned beyond any <hi>Quaker</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (or for what we know in <hi>England)</hi> while 'tis believed his Table is ſupplied with <hi>varieties</hi> beyond any of theirs (tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his eager purſute after the <hi>Quakers</hi> made him forget that part, or elſe thinks he ought to have a <hi>diſpenſation</hi> beyond them) But does the Bp. go to <hi>Market</hi> himſelf, or doth he write upon reports? if upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, doth it become him to write to the Defamation of any people upon bare report,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:173010:74"/> which for ought he knows may be falſe, and we know is falſe as he ſtates it? for the <hi>Quakers</hi> of <hi>Cork,</hi> whom as we take it he means, by the word <hi>here,</hi> deny they are ſtill the <hi>earlieſt Chapmen;</hi> yet that ſome of them go with others at the common market time no doubt is true, and where is the <hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>Carnality</hi> of it? if there be any the Bp. muſt be concerned in it, ſince (if it be true as we are informed) his <hi>Caterer</hi> has been obſerved to be generally one of the firſt there, tho' we will not ſay as the Bp. doth, <hi>ſtill the earlieſt,</hi> becauſe ſome extraordinary thing might occaſion his coming later then uſual, and by that means perhaps miſs a piece of meat for his Lord, (as he ſtiled him) which perhaps a <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> (or ſome other) had bought before, which we will not ſay was the occaſion of this reflection, but probable enough it was ſo—Well, but the Bp. ſays we are the <hi>beſt Chapmen,</hi> and comes off with <hi>much good may they do them.</hi> Then ſay we to the firſt, the Butchers have no reaſon to complain of us, and to the laſt, what ever good he would have the meat do us 'tis plain he did not intend the ſtory in kindneſs, while he makes it a <hi>Scandalous Inſtance.</hi> Now as to our <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> we hope we do it in the <hi>fear of God,</hi> and in <hi>moderation,</hi> let the Bp. ſay what he will; and if the Bp's.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:173010:75"/> aptneſs to vilifie the <hi>Quakers</hi> had not been uppermoſt and moſt prevalent with him he might with a great deal more eaſe, have found thoſe nearer to him then the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are guilty of great Exceſſes, as <hi>riotous Feaſting, Drunkeneſs, Sporting, Games, Plays, Pride, Wantonneſs,</hi> with many ſuch like things that appear (but too plain) to be <hi>groſs carnality,</hi> and which behoved the Bp. to ſee his own Flock more clear of, before he had brought this Inſtance to prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> guilty of <hi>Carnality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We would have the Reader obſerve that the Bp. in this page. 21. (which we are now upon) had made a mixture of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven charges,</hi> which we could not ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly anſwer without bringing the parts of each charge together (which lay diſtant) as we did in the foregoing inſtance of <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,</hi> ſo we do now in that of his Charging us with <hi>worldlineſs.</hi> Thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If minding worldly gain</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>and being ſo intent on it Day and Night; as to paſs moſt days in the week without a Prayer to God, either in publick Aſſembly or private Family; if the ſlieſt ways, both to get Money and to keep it be worldlineſs, he knows no ſort of People according to the degree of each given to thoſe vices more then the Quakers:</hi> (and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the end of that page goes on thus.)<hi>—And indeed how they ſhould be a heavenly</hi>

               <hi>minded People who ſo much reſtrain Prayer, that is lay aſide, forbear or neglect it as to common practice, (at leaſt have done ſo) till of very late Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If <hi>charges</hi> were <hi>proofs</hi> in theſe and other Inſtances, the Bp. had no doubt made us ſome of the worſt of People, but to be <hi>reviled</hi> and <hi>abuſed</hi> without cauſe has fallen to our lot, which we may not ſtrange at ſince it was the lot of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians</hi> from the Men of that age, and more eſpecially from the <hi>chief Prieſts.</hi> Now as to that groſs and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table reflection upon our getting Money, we have already ſpoken to it before, ſo it needs no farther anſwer here; But that we appeal to the <hi>Searcher of Hearts,</hi> who beſt knows whether we have preferred, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded <hi>worldly things</hi> above the <hi>things of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to <hi>Prayer,</hi> we ſay it is a falſe charge, that we ever did, either for <hi>worldly gain,</hi> or upon <hi>any other account Reſtrain, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect,</hi> or <hi>lay aſide Prayer,</hi> either of late Years or from the beginning. Indeed if the Bp. means the many <hi>ſet forms of Prayer</hi> made ready to our hands by Men, he's in the right, in ſaying we neglect them, (tho' not to get worldly gain) and hope we ſhall do ſo to the end, and we tell him, if ſuch <hi>formal Prayers</hi> would make Men better
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:173010:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and more acceptable to God, there is a Church that perhaps far exceeds his for multitude of <hi>Prayers,</hi> namely that of <hi>Rome.</hi> But as to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> they firmly believe no <hi>Prayer</hi> is acceptable to God unleſs performed by and through the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> which doth not only conſiſt in <hi>Vocal</hi> but <hi>Mental Prayer,</hi> according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>We know not what we ſhould Pray for, as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> Again 1 Cor. 14. 15. <hi>I will Pray with the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.—This ſort of <hi>Prayer</hi> we dearly own, and to Gods praiſe without boaſting we can ſay, we have had and ſtill have it frequently among us, not only in our <hi>publick Meetings,</hi> but alſo in <hi>private Families,</hi> both <hi>Vocally</hi> and <hi>Internally,</hi> and not only ſo, but we are taught by the help of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>Pray in Spirit every where,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. as well in our Buſineſs and Callings as in our publick Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (21.) The Bp. ſays <hi>he could men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more Scandalous Particulars or Inſtances, both of carnality and worldlineſs among them, but it is not agreable to his Temper.</hi> For a Man to ſay the worſt he can, (which we ſuppoſe the Bp. has done, and more than is true, and then pretends he could ſay more, is, we think, a <hi>

            <p> Again, (the Bp. <hi>p.</hi> 22.) <hi>Let Mr.</hi> P. <hi>then know, whatſoever Mens attainments may be, its not good ſo much to boaſt of their being Spiritual.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God he knows we <hi>boaſt</hi> not, (nor have we any thing whereof to <hi>boaſt)</hi> as of our ſelves, but may we not without <hi>boaſting</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 17. <hi>Tell others what God hath done for our Souls.</hi> And having by good experience witneſſed the good and bleſſed effects of the <hi>Light, Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of God upon our <hi>Souls;</hi> ſhall we not in the love of God call and invite others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? ſurely we may, and if for theſe things we are accounted <hi>boaſters,</hi> we muſt and ſhall be content to bear this reproach with the reſt.</p>
            <p>Ibid.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It would take up much time and Paper to be ſo large upon theſe Objections of the Bp's. as we could be, to ſhew how that through the coming in of the Apoſtacy Men became <hi>outſide</hi> and <hi>nominal Chriſtians,</hi> by forſaking and neglecting the inward guidance of the <hi>Grace and Spirit of God,</hi> and inſtead thereof ſet up <hi>outward Forms,</hi> and <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> of Men: But we ſhall be brief, and only and this, that God in his infinite goodneſs is bringing his Church out of the Wilderneſs, and from the <hi>teachings of Man,</hi> to the <hi>teachings of his good Spirit.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> As to ſuch extraordinary and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts of the Spirit, as of <hi>healing the Diſeaſed,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking with tongues</hi> which the Apoſtles had, we ſhall at preſent only return the Bp. the ſame anſwer, which the firſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> uſually gave the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who demanded a confirmation of their <hi>New</hi> Doctrine (as they termed it) by <hi>Miracles;</hi> to which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> replied that they Preached no <hi>New Goſpel,</hi> but the ſame which was confirmed before by Miracles, and therefore needed no new ones to confirm it; and alſo that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> with many of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> tho' immediately and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:173010:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> called, yet did no <hi>Miracles</hi> that we read of; and the ſame anſwer may ſerve for us, while we have always been ready to confirm our Doctrine by holy Scripture: but altho' ſuch extraordinary Gifts of Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ceaſed, yet it doth not therefore follow, we ought to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the inward teachings and dictates of the <hi>holy Spirit of God,</hi> which is given to Chriſtians, as a ſtanding perpetual rule, and more immediate guide under the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to walk by, and without which they cannot rightly perform their duty to God, as we have ſhewn before. <hi>(p.</hi> 54.) As to that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. brought by the Bp. 'Tis plain thoſe Gifts there mentioned were to ceaſe, by giving way to what was more excellent, more perfect; ſee p. 10. 11, 12. following verſ. and not by being ſucceeded by what is more <hi>carnal,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> but leaving this at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we ſhall attend the Bp's.

            </p>
            <p>To which we anſwer, If that were ſo, then none can preach as the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> nor in preaching be beneficial to the People, ſince the holy Scripture tells us, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> is a neceſſary and eſſential qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conſtitute a <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt</hi> which

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:173010:78"/> whom they could do nothing, and purſuant to that commiſſion and promiſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Apoſtles were called, commiſſionated, and did Preach by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> according to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Gall.</hi> 1. 11, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. and we do not find the Apoſtles did confine the <hi>Spirit</hi> to themſelves only, but did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the ſame Gift of the <hi>Spirit</hi> as the neceſſary qualification to the conſtituting a <hi>Miniſter of the Goſpel.</hi> (thus) 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4. 10, 11. <hi>As every Man hath received the Gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another as good ſtewards of the manifold Grace of God.

P. <hi>nor none can now Preach in demonſtration of the Spirit and Power,</hi> 'tis but his bare aſſertion, and more
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:173010:79"/> then he can prove.—But as to the Bp's. part, we may be ſure he cannot ſo Preach ſince he denies it to all, and while he thus aſſerts, he will do well to conſider, how he came by his Miniſtry, ſince Chriſt promiſed to be with his Miniſters to the end of the World, and that his <hi>Spirit</hi> was to continue with and in them for ever; from which Gift of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> they were to ſpeak (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle) as the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> which to be ſure cannot be but <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit and Power.—</hi>Having thus Proved the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Qualification to the conſtituting a Miniſter of Chriſt, we now come to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bp's. <hi>outward way</hi> to <hi>Holyneſs</hi> and <hi>Spirituallity,</hi> in which we ſhall find him as much out of the way as in the laſt.

               <hi>ſtrongly moved by the Power of the Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Miniſtry of the Word, to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch Duties, have yielded themſelves and ſubmitted to the Conduct of the holy Ghoſt leading them by Scripture into all truth, as well as Holineſs.</hi> Thus, Reader, we have given thee this long Citation of the Bp's. that his own words may fully ſpeak his mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Bp. hath here aſſerted upon his own authority and without proof, that <hi>People are now made holy by the uſe of outward means,</hi> and that <hi>there are thoſe, who by Study and induſtry attain to ſpeak with tongues, may be termed Spiritual:</hi> But contrary hereunto the holy Scriptures do abundantly prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That People are <hi>made holy</hi> and <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> by <hi>inward means,</hi> as we ſhall plainly ſhew, only before we proceed we will here again give the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> their due place, and allow them to be whatſoever they ſay of themſelves, according to theſe or any other Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. believing them to be the beſt Writings extant in the World, and we love honour and eſteem them beyond all others, and are ſo far from laying them aſide as uſeleſs, that we ſay they are inſtrumental, a furtherance and help to Believers in the work of the Lord; but then we ſay 'tis through Faith which is the fruit of the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:173010:80"/> 
               <hi>Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 22. And thus they furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Man of <hi>God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. for ſo he was to be, that received thoſe benefits by them; and we are ſo far from excluding the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> from being helpful and beneficial to us, that we exclude not other outward and inſtrumental means, as <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. But ſtill we ſay it is by the Gift of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> by the illumination of which (and as the foundation) all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means become beneficial and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us; and thus, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14.<hi>—Lydia—Whoſe heart the Lord opened that ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto the things which were ſpoken by Paul.</hi> Here 'twas the Lord opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> by which means as the efficient cauſe <hi>Paul's</hi> preaching became ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to her; thus much briefly as to the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi> Now to the Bp's. words before Cited, wherein he has aſſerted, <hi>that People are now made holy by the uſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means,</hi> and from the <hi>Scriptures learnt the mind of the Spirit.</hi> Whereas we ſay the principal agent and by which People are made holy, is the <hi>Grace and Spirit of God,</hi> which we now come to prove by Scripture. Thus, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. <hi>But the anointing ye have received, abideth in you, and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing teacheth you of all things, Rom.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>But that which may be known of God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt</hi>

And wicked Men alſo hath this Gift and means in themſelves, tho' they will not make uſe of it nor regard it: Thus the Slothful Servant, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 18. had a Talent tho' he made no uſe of it, and the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the worſt of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Luk. 17. 21. <hi>had the Kingdom of Heaven within them.</hi> Thus having ſhewn (by a few of the many Texts we could produce) <hi>the means to be inward;</hi> we now come to prove People are <hi>made holy</hi> by this <hi>inward means,</hi> viz. the Gift of the <hi>holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.—</hi>Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live; but if ye live after the Fleſh ye ſhall die,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.—Neither Fornicators, Idolators, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terors,—Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers, Extortioners,—and ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, Sanctified, Juſtified in the name of our Lord Jeſus and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our God,</hi> Eph. 4. 7. <hi>Unto every one is given Grace, according to the meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt,</hi> Titus 2. 11. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appeared unto all Men, teaching us that denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Worldly Luſts we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent World.</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:173010:81"/> Eph. 5. 9, 10. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is all Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, and Truth.</hi> Again <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. <hi>the Spirit was to guide into all truth;</hi> then the Children of God were to be led <hi>by his Spirit,</hi> and none were his, but ſuch as was guided thereby, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 14. In ſhort 'tis needleſs to bring more of the numerous Scripture Teſtimonies which might be cited to prove this point, but theſe may ſuffice to ſhew that People are <hi>made holy</hi> by the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit of God within Men</hi> and not by <hi>outward means,</hi> as the Bp. hath aſſerted, and the ſame way they are made <hi>holy,</hi> they are likewiſe made <hi>Spiritual,</hi> it being impoſſible to be a <hi>holy Man</hi> without being <hi>Spiritual,</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>To be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded is life and peace.—</hi>And the way whereby Men become <hi>Spiritual</hi> is by the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. to 15.

If he ſhall retract, and tell us, as the holy Scripture doth, that People are led into all <hi>Truth</hi> and Holineſs by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> we ſhall then agree in that point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (23.) The Bp. goes on, telling us the ſeveral effects producible in his way of Spirituality and Holineſs, and <hi>p.</hi> 24. ſays thus, <hi>Let ſuch Perſons as theſe be allowed to be Spiritual; and if ſo, the Bp. ſays he doubts not but there will be found more ſuch who are no Quakers, then who really are; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Bp. claims to be ſuch an one him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and challenges Mr.</hi> P. <hi>to prove the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:173010:82"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We will not differ with him about the numbers of his ſort of Spiritually made Men, and that they do exceed the <hi>Quakers,</hi> believing it true; But we have already proved the <hi>Bp's. outward way,</hi> and the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inward way</hi> to Holineſs and Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity do widely differ, and as they ſo do, the effects in reallity muſt do the ſame, and therefore we ſhall be very brief with the Bp. as to his challenge, and tell him, tho' we allow him alſo to be a <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> according to his <hi>outward way</hi> of making them, yet <hi>W. P.</hi> nor we need not goe about to prove that he is no <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Scripture Definition,</hi> ſince he has ſo effectually done it himſelf.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid</hi> (24.) The Bp. proceeds, <hi>as to emptineſs the Bp. craves pardon if he be at a loſs what Mr.</hi> P. <hi>means thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why the Bp. at a loſs, ſince <hi>W. P.</hi> ſpoke ſo very plain as to the emptineſs of the Clergy, while in <hi>p.</hi> 107, 108. he tells him 'tis <hi>preaching without the Spirit</hi> in a <hi>life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and humane miniſtry,</hi> and ſuch as were made <hi>Miniſters by humane Learning and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> whereas the Miniſters of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuch by the Qualifications an <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as he had proved, and which is further confirmed by us.</p>
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:173010:82"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (24.) <hi>If emptineſs</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>ſignifies the Miniſters Sermons being barren, with little ſubſtance or ſolid matter in them, the Quakers are much more guilty, as far as ever the Bp's experience could reach; witneſs the firſt things they publiſhed, if compared to the Printed Sermons of the conformable Clergy, ſince Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>acceſſion to them, it muſt be confeſt, he has much improved them, and brought them to write what looks like ſenſe and Coherence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We cannot wonder the Bp. ſhould ſpeak in the behalf of that Clergy being one of the number himſelf, and againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom he hath endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and therefore, to be ſure, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judg of either our Preaching or Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for which reaſon we ſhall appeal from him to more competent and impartial Judges, in relation to both; but this we will ſay, that altho' the <hi>Quakers</hi> were never <hi>againſt,</hi> but <hi>for</hi> true ſenſe and coherence in Preaching and Writing, yet we lay no ſuch ſtreſs or neceſſity upon the <hi>Learning, Arts, Parts,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> in doing either, as perhaps the Bp. doth; and he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the greateſt Truths, namely the holy Scriptures, are delivered in a Style ſuted to the meaneſt capacities. Again that Learned Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending the Learning and wiſdom of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:173010:83"/> Men, and excellency of Speech in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. that he both oppoſes as well as diſeſteems and undervalues them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either a means or furtherance to the work of the Lord. On the Contrary he exalts the <hi>weak, fooliſh and deſpiſed things of the World as more acceptable to God,</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. to 29. and has this ſame up again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 13. thus, <hi>Which things we alſo ſpeak not in the words which Mans wiſdom teacheth. But which the holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing Spiritual things with Spiritual.</hi> Here the Apoſtle point blank oppoſes Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallity, and the teachings of the holy Ghoſt, to the wiſdom and teachings of Men, contrary whereunto (as we have before obſerved) the Bp. hath aſſerted, that Men may ſtill be termed <hi>Spiritual</hi> by <hi>outward Study</hi> and <hi>Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> they are of the ſame mind with the Apoſtle, and are ſo far from valuing the moſt excellent Preaching proceeding from the <hi>Arts, Parts, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> of <hi>this World</hi> without the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Teaching,</hi> that they prefer far above and beyond it, a few plain mean words either from Man or Woman, as proceeding from the Motion of the <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> and altho ſuch ſpeech or words may ſeem very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eyes of the wiſe and learned Men of this World, in their <hi>natural State,</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:173010:83"/> yet ſuch Preaching carries an evidence with it to the <hi>enlightned underſtanding,</hi> far excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the other, not only to illiterate perſons but to ſuch alſo, who have had the Arts and Literature of this World, whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings have been opened by the <hi>Divine Spirit.—</hi>And as to <hi>W. P.</hi> tho' we eſteem and Love him yet 'tis not barely either for his <hi>Parts</hi> or <hi>Learning,</hi> but for his <hi>Chriſtian ſincerity towards God and his Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again the Bp. <hi>(p.</hi> 24.) <hi>But the Bp. would willingly know of Mr.</hi> P. <hi>what there was in</hi> B. Wheddons <hi>holding Forth.—after Mr.</hi> P. <hi>at</hi> Cork <hi>when he put his hat before his face and laughed, and whether ſhe be the only perſon from whom in their Aſſemblies he has often heard ſuch ſtuff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this ſtory as well as other things, relating perſonally to <hi>W. P.</hi> the Bp. took care to let <hi>W. P.</hi> be gone out of <hi>Europe</hi> before he publiſhed his <hi>Book:</hi> we ſuppoſe the Bp. don't pretend to give this ſtory from his own knowledg, how well then doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com the Bp. to write ſuch ſtories upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and is not that word <hi>holding Forth</hi> uſed in deriſion or ſcorn? but what <hi>ſtuff?</hi> why did not the Bp. tell us the <hi>ſtuff?</hi> if he knew, and if he did not, he might with more credit have been ſilent to the ſtory, while in thus doing he only demonſtrates his willing mind to bring any ſtory (tho'
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:173010:84"/> it be a lame one) in hopes to vilifie the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But as to the ſtory of <hi>W.</hi> P's. <hi>laughing</hi> 'tis as improbable as frivolous, and which we no more believe, then that the late <hi>Bp. of Cork</hi> is now in <hi>China. (1ſt.)</hi> becauſe <hi>W. P.</hi> is a Man of a ſolid carriage and grave Deportment, and in his common converſation ſeldom if ever given to <hi>laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and not very often to <hi>ſmile.—</hi>But that he ſhould <hi>laugh</hi> at what was ſpoken in a meeting by a Woman of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and in a place too, where perhaps there were many ſcores if not hundreds of Auditors beſides Quakers.</p>
            <p>We ſay that he ſhould laugh under all thoſe circumſtances is ſo ridiculouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that we ſhould think none will believe it, but ſuch as will not disbelieve any ſtory what ever againſt the <hi>Quakers. (2ly.)</hi> We let the Bp. know whatever the Cuſtom of <hi>laughing</hi> be <hi>in his congregation</hi> we have no ſuch in <hi>ours;</hi> and whoſoever the Bp's. Spie or Informer was, we ſuppoſe him one who uſed to laugh in his own Church or elſe (to be ſure) he would not have imagined <hi>W. P.</hi> to laugh in our Meeting. But that <hi>W. P.</hi> might pull his hat before his eyes (while ſhe was ſpeaking) may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, it being very uſual for him ſo to do in our Meetings, which perhaps this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obſerving, might imagin he laughed,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:173010:84"/> while it was only the effects of a ſtrong prepoſſeſſion of mind, as knowing it was common to laugh in his own Church; this is the moſt charitable conſtruction we can put upon that improbable ſtory: But if this were not the caſe, we then conclude it to be a wilful forgery to make a ſtory to the Bp. whom the Informer might know was ready enough to receive one againſt <hi>him</hi> and the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (25.) And part of 26. is about the maintainance for the Miniſtry; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we find <hi>W. P.</hi> touched a tender place, while he treated upon this head, which is apparent by the Bp's. being greatly diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we may conclude reviling and abuſing <hi>W. P.</hi> be an indication thereof. <hi>viz. p.</hi> 25. ſaith the Bp. <hi>A Man will be ſtrongly tempted to an unluckly gueſs where that perſon</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>W.

Again, the Bp. <hi>p.</hi> 26. <hi>If Mr.</hi> P. <hi>be not popiſhly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, which hath been long feared of him, and that on very likely grounds, it may be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected hence that he has a greater kindneſs for Atheiſm then is conſiſtant with his profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Bp's. fear and Suſpition that <hi>W. P.</hi> is either <hi>popiſhly</hi> or <hi>Atheiſticaly</hi> affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proceeds from the ſame ground, and are alike true, as that he died a Papiſt about ſixteen years ago in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and this
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:173010:85"/> was put in Print too by ſome of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: But we muſt tell the Bp. <hi>W. P's.</hi> Credit in thoſe two points are above the reach of his Cenſorious pen, not only with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but with many Men of note and Character in the World even of the <hi>Bp's. own Church.</hi> Well, but why muſt <hi>W. P.</hi> be affected to <hi>Popery</hi> or have a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for <hi>Atheiſm</hi> with the Bp? why? 'tis becauſe he is for <hi>a free Goſpel Miniſtry,</hi> and obſerves the <hi>Miniſtry is become too much a temporal preferment, and few to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who court not ſtations of greateſt profit and Honour;</hi> ſee <hi>W. P's. Defence</hi> 109. which indeed falls ſo very pat, and touches the Bp. ſo to the Quick (upon his late <hi>remove)</hi> (tho' no doubt was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to <hi>W. P.)</hi> that 'tis not ſo much to be wondered at, why he ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie under it. But had the Bp. rightly conſidered, he could not have ſuppoſed that <hi>W. P's.</hi> diſlike of <hi>Tythes</hi> or other forced Maintainance proceeded from his being <hi>popiſhly</hi> affected, becauſe <hi>Tythes</hi> as a ſettled maintainance were introduced in time of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (25.) The Bp. tells us, meaning <hi>W. P. would have ſo great a body as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry in theſe Kingdoms all become ſomewhat like mendicant Friers. No Rents or Dues muſt be allowed them, but Alms and Gifts, with</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:173010:85"/> 
               <hi>what then</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>are they likely to be more ſincere in their Doctrine by being put to pleaſe Men that they may give them Alms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, <hi>W. P.</hi> nor the <hi>Quakers</hi> would not have the Miniſtry Beggers, nor yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like <hi>Mendicant Friers,</hi> their begging way being nothing like the Apoſtles way of maintainance, and yet we would have ſuch as have occaſion, to be ſatisfied with <hi>Chriſt's free allowance,</hi> which was no other then free Gifts, and from the hands of ſuch too, as did receive them and their miniſtry; ſee <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. And this maintainance we find the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, and were ſatisfied with, tho' it ſeems ſo far from pleaſing the Bp. that he makes it a temptation to pleaſe Men: Surely we hope the Bp. will allow, that <hi>our Lord</hi> knew better then he, and that his command and way of a free maintainance, was not what would lead his Miniſters into a temptation to be Men-pleaſers, and we think it was not reverent, and what became a Bp. to draw ſuch a conſequence, whereby he implicitely reflected on the <hi>Chriſtian Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> tho' intended. directly againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> and the <hi>Quakers.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> Ibid. 25. Says the <hi>Bp. miraculous ſupports and ceaſed with Miracles themſelves.</hi> What miraculous ſupports? we find none
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:173010:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> required, they (viz. the Apoſtles) were manifeſt to Mens Conſciences, (is that ceaſed now?) and received what was ſet before them, and from thoſe who would not receive them, nor their doctrine, they departed, and ſhook off the duſt of their feet.</p>
            <p>The Bp. tells us <hi>Ibid.</hi> 25. <hi>Mr.</hi> P. <hi>no where moves, that thoſe laws which forbid Miniſters to exerciſe Merchandizing, Mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks or Secular Employments, may be abrogated or taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ask whether thoſe Laws are <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Canon?</hi> and upon what occaſion theſe Laws were made? and whether it was not becauſe of the <hi>great covetouſneſs</hi> of the Clergy, who not being content with the exceſſive gain of <hi>Tythes,</hi> were ſo greedy of gain, that they would be getting other ways too? (and perhaps by <hi>wily</hi> and <hi>ſly</hi> ways as the Bp. ſlanders the <hi>Quakers.)</hi> We farther ask the Bp. if <hi>W. P.</hi> or the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhould move, as he ſpeaks, will he promiſe for himſelf and engage or endeavour with the reſt of the Clergy, they will be content without Tythes, provided thoſe Laws be Repealed, when we know his mind he may hear farther; in the mean time, without he had let us know his mind in that caſe, we think his Objection was to little purpoſe. But ſays the Bp.</p>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. (1ſt.)</hi> This Scripture, tho' the chief the Bp. could bring, will make very little for his purpoſe to prove <hi>Tythes</hi> and other <hi>forced maintainance,</hi> due under the Goſpel diſpenſation, which was the point the Bp. ought to prove if he could, and which to be ſure he never can do by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(2ly.)</hi> The Quakers never denied or diſallowed ſuch a living as we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Paul</hi> doth here mean, to wit the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> who preached the Goſpel ſhould be ſupplied with ſuch neceſſaries of Food and Raiment as they ſtood in need of; but as then ſo now, it's to come <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> and from the hands of ſuch too who had partaken of their miniſtry, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them to be Miniſters of Chriſt, and to this agrees <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 27. <hi>If the Gentiles have been partakers of their Spiritual things their duty is alſo to miniſter unto them in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>(3ly.)</hi> This ſort of living and this way of maintainance for Miniſters of Chriſt (who ſtand in need of and want neceſſaries)
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:173010:87"/> we are for, and with which agrees the very command of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when he ſent forth his Diſciples, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 8, 9. <hi>freely ye have received, freely give;</hi> But at the ſame time bids them neither <hi>provide Gold, Silver, or Braſs in their purſes, neither two coats, nor ſhoes,</hi> and gives the reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch proviſion. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is worthy of his meat;</hi> as much as to ſay, tho' you are to preach freely, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to command or demand any thing for Preaching, yet you may receive ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries as you want or ſtand in need of. Now who are they to receive this from, but from ſuch who received them, for he bids them ſhake off the <hi>duſt of their feet,</hi> as a teſtimony againſt ſuch who would neither <hi>receive them, nor hear their words.</hi> Verſ. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(4ly.)</hi> Beyond the extent of Chriſt's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance and the perſons from whom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, we are not to underſtand that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. nor indeed are we to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it otherwiſe from the context it ſelf, <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> Becauſe 'twas to the Believers he then wrote, therefore from the <hi>Believers</hi> only the Miniſters of Chriſt were to take what was given. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> was far from intending a great and <hi>lordly allowance</hi> or living; hear what he ſaith, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. What is <hi>my reward then</hi> (ſays he) <hi>verily that when I preach the Goſpel, I may make</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:173010:88"/> 
               <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt without charge, that I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe not my power in the Goſpel.</hi> From whence two things are obſerveable. <hi>(1ſt.)</hi> That he makes it rewardable to preach without charge, conſequently then the more charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the leſs rewardable. <hi>(2ly.)</hi> That there was a danger of abuſing the Goſpel Power (which muſt be only underſtood in taking neceſſaries according to Chriſts allowance,) therefore being ſo nice a point, and having regard to his reward, and fearing he might abuſe his power, he choſe rather to work with his own hands, then take any thing at all, which he did to the ſupply of his own, and the neceſſities of them that were with him, in which he became a good pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Example to others.</p>
            <p>Thus he tells the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> 20. 33, 34, 35. <hi>I have coveted no Mans Silver, Gold, or Apparell, theſe hands have adminiſtered unto my neceſſities, and to them that were with me:</hi> we think it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no longer a doubt, what ſort of living and maintainance <hi>Paul</hi> allowed the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. viz. to receive at the hands of Believers for to anſwer their neceſſities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(5ly.)</hi> Now, Impartial Reader, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Goſpel allowance from Chriſt Jeſus our Lord and what we are to underſtand from <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13, 14. (the place
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:173010:88"/> cited by the Bp.) and ſee what proportion or equality it holds with <hi>Tythes</hi> and other <hi>forced maintainance</hi> in our day, and whether they, who pretend to be Miniſters of Chriſt, and get ſo many hundreds, if not ſome of them ſome thouſands by the Year for preaching, do not unreaſonably exceed as well as abuſe the Goſpel power and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance which Paul <hi>allowed</hi> the miniſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (25.) The Bp. proceeds thus, <hi>The Bp. doubts not to affirm, that take away the Eſtabliſhed Miniſtry (which in moral ſpeaking cannot ſubſiſt without a maintainance) and let our Pariſh Churches be left deſtitute of learned Preachers, and not only Popery in ſome places, but Irreligion and Barbarity more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally would ſoon enſue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt part of the Bp's. words are not hard to be underſtood, and are as plain, as we believe them true, which we take to be that if the Miniſters ſettled Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be taken away, the Miniſtry will fall <hi>and the Churches be left deſtitute of them.—</hi>Then ſay we if <hi>maintainance</hi> uphold and ſupports them we think it's plain that <hi>maintainance</hi> is their <hi>foundation,</hi> ſince they fall without it: We ask then whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters they are? ſince <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>foundation</hi> of his truly conſtituted Miniſters, with whom he promiſed to be to the end of the World, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 20. and upon whom
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:173010:89"/> a neceſſity was laid to preach the Goſpel, and who were ſo far from forbearing to preach for want of a <hi>ſettled maintainance,</hi> that <hi>cruel Sufferings,</hi> as <hi>Whipping, Stoning, Impriſonment,</hi> nay <hi>death it ſelf</hi> could not deter or hinder them therefrom, the hands of theſe we find adminiſtred to their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereas the Bp's. miniſtry, morally ſpeaking (as he tells us) cannot ſubſiſt, and that the Churches will be left deſtitute of them in caſe they are not upheld by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled maintainance: We could ſay much more upon this head, but forbear and refer, to the Impartial Reader upon a ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether ſuch be true <hi>Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> as the Bp. has ſtated them, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>maintainance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Bp's. conſequence that <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Barbarity would enſue,</hi> in caſe <hi>the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht Miniſtry were taken away,</hi> (by forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the maintainance.)</p>
            <p>We anſwer the conſequence is not true; for when the Clergy's maintainance was greater in theſe Nations, before Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were taken from them, there was more <hi>Popery, Irreligion,</hi> and <hi>Barbarity</hi> then now, and perhaps would be leſs if <hi>Tythes</hi> were wholly down, and all preachers left to a free maintainance. Now as to <hi>Popery,</hi> there would be little danger of that, becauſe if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were ſure before hand to miſs of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:173010:89"/> the ſweet gain of <hi>Tythes,</hi> &amp;c. they would no more trouble the Churches or People then the Bp's. Miniſtry, ſince they never fail, wherever they get footing to promote <hi>Tythes,</hi> and are as much for upholding them, as the Bp. or his Miniſtry can be; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently then the Churches would be as deſtitute of them as of the Bp's. Miniſtry, and therefore no danger of Popery. Next as to <hi>Irreligion and Barbarity ſoon enſuing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There would be as little danger thence, as of <hi>Popery, ſince</hi> inſtead of <hi>Men made Miniſters,</hi> and ſuch whoſe prop and foundation is <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>forced maintainance,</hi> we might not doubt the good providence of God in ſending us Miniſters of <hi>his own mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> who would preach <hi>freely</hi> as they had received the ſame, and in ſo doing would come with leſs ſuſpition of worldly and ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ends, while gain and advantage was no motive to their undertaking of that Office and the effects of ſuch miniſters preaching as theſe, no doubt would be far from intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <hi>Popery, Barbarity,</hi> or <hi>Irreligion,</hi> that in all probability People would generally and ſooner become better Chriſtians under ſuch a Miniſtry, then they now are under the Eſtabliſht ones.</p>
            <p>P. 26. <hi>In Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>Judgment</hi> (ſays the Bp.) <hi>they muſt be all hirelings and Hypocrites, and the Bp. himſelf need not look far for ſuch</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:173010:90"/> 
               <hi>—he is too ſenſibly inſtructed in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>P.) for a parting blow.—</hi>(And in a few lines after the Bp. adds thus) <hi>the Bp. mean-while for himſelf hereby Summon's</hi> W.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We might with much more reaſon return the like Summons to the Bp. for his great abuſe of <hi>W. P.</hi> in particular, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, as we have ſhewn, and by this Inſtance we find he reſolves to hold out unfair to <hi>W. P.</hi> to the end, in laying down words in a different character as <hi>W. P's.</hi> tho' they are none of his directly, and not only ſo, but adding with a break between ſome words Eight pages diſtant to anſwer his purpoſe, without giving any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, therefore we ſhall Cite <hi>W. P's.</hi> Words in both places as they lye in his <hi>Defence.</hi> Thus <hi>(p.</hi> 122.) <hi>If he (i. e.</hi> the Bp.) <q>Hath any ſhot left againſt mercenary Religioniſt he may not miſs the mark next time, but make it his main aim, end, and ſtudy to expoſe Hirelings and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in their proper colours; and ſome are of opinion, he need not go far to find too many of them. <hi>Again, p.</hi> 130. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend to tell the Bp. what tribe of Men in Chriſtendom it is, that have long
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:173010:90"/> made gain their godlineſs, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thereof their worldly inheritance, ſince he has been, ſo much more ſenſibly inſtructed in this affair then my ſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Pray Reader compare theſe Citations with what the Bp. has laid down as <hi>W. P's.</hi> and ſee if they do not differ, but ſince the Bp. by falſifying <hi>W. P's.</hi> words, <hi>p.</hi> 122. and by ſo doing apply'd them directly to himſelf, which is plain <hi>W. P.</hi> did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Bp. be included in the number <hi>[too many]</hi> and ſince 'tis very plain as <hi>W. P.</hi> hath told him, <hi>p.</hi> 130. he is more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inſtructed in getting worldly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for a Spiritual conſideration then <hi>W. P.</hi> is. We ſay ſince the caſe is thus it will lie upon the Bp. to rectifie and give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his unfairneſs (in this as well as other Citations, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> as well as to clear himſelf of <hi>W. P's.</hi> laſt aſſertion (by way of compariſon) in getting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gain Godlineſs, they were in return to the Bp's. ſuggeſting the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſuch a People in his <hi>Teſtimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> (26.) The Bp. proceeds thus, he <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Bp.) <hi>is further bold to tell the World that both he and diverſe of his brethren with him in a certain City laboured in the Miniſtry both day and night, when they had neither Lands nor Tythes, nor other Revenues to ſupport them—And did feed their Flock.</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:173010:91"/> 
               <hi>—That the very perſons or others of their party, who now call that ſpoiling, which is but making ſome of their party pay a ſmall pittance of Legal Dues, were at that time in power at Court or otherwiſe; and inſtead of Preaching, were Directors of publick Councils for no good or much miſchief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Bp. could have boldly told us, that he and his brethren fed their Flock freely, and at ſuch a time when they could have compelled People to pay <hi>Tythes</hi> and other maintainance, but would not do it, becauſe 'twas no Goſpel maintainance, we ſay if he could have thus told us it would indeed have been not only <hi>bold</hi> but well <hi>told</hi> too; but to tell the world he fed his Flock without <hi>Tythes, &amp;c.</hi> in a time of War, when 'twas not in his power to get them, we think by ſuch his boldneſs, he will merit no great Commendations; and as to ſtaying with his Flock in a time of danger, 'twas but his reaſonable duty ſo to do, if it were only for his being largely pay'd (by them) before. We will not ſay he would have left them if he could, but he knows that unleſs he had gon off in the beginning of the troubles, 'twas almoſt next to impoſſible to get away afterwards; and certain it is many who did ſtay would gladly have gon afterwards if they could, whether he was one of that number he beſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:173010:91"/> knows. Next as to our not <hi>paying a ſmall pittance of Legal Dues</hi> (as he calls them.) We anſwer 'tis for conſcience ſake we deny ſuch payments, as not believing <hi>Tythes,</hi> &amp;c. due to a Goſpel Miniſtry, and as to the Legality of them, we diſpute not the point, but ſay ſince he demands and takes them for a <hi>Spiritual conſideration,</hi> he ought to prove his right to <hi>Tythes,</hi> &amp;c. by a <hi>divine Sanction,</hi> as well as inſiſt upon the Legality of them.</p>
            <p>Now to the laſt part of his charge, where he inſinuates that <hi>ſome Preachers amongſt us were great at Court or otherwiſe, and inſtead of Preaching, were Directors of publick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils for no good or much miſchief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This charge (as a parting blow to ſpeak in the Bp's. words) as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true ſo it is equally unfair, not only in his being ſilent as to the perſon or perſons that were ſuch, <hi>no good or much miſchief Directors,</hi> (if he knew them) but alſo in not telling the World what that <hi>no good</hi> or <hi>much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> was, ſuch did, that hereby the matter being known, the World might judg, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was criminal or not, and if particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons were guilty they might bear their own blame, and the Innocent be cleared, but neither of theſe the Bp. has done, for a good reaſon (no doubt) becauſe he could not do it. But the Bp. perhaps
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:173010:92"/> thought this general and hidden way beſt to ſerve his end, which we cannot believe was any other then thereby to calumniate the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general; all the pretence that we can ſuppoſe for this charge is, that ſome few (perhaps not above a dozen at moſt in all the Nation, if ſo many) of our Friends were (very much againſt their minds) nominated <hi>Common Counſel-men,</hi> and ſome of them <hi>Aldermen</hi> in particular incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale Towns, as likewiſe at the ſame time were far greater numbers of other Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants (which tho' a crime in us yet none in them with the Bp.) And as to preachers, we do not believe there was at moſt above two or three in the Nation of that number it ſelf, nay we know but of one. But that either preachers or hearers were <hi>great at Court</hi> at all, or <hi>Directors of publick Councils,</hi> as the Bp. ſaith, we utterly deny, unleſs he will call: <hi>W. B.</hi> one, who yet was no Preacher, nor indeed was he in unity with us. On the contrary we are bold to tell the World (as the Bp. did,) we think with leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) and which we ſhould not have done but that it is extorted from us on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> in moſt parts of the Nation did contribute large Summs to the relief of <hi>diſtreſſed Proteſtants</hi> and never failed to do them good on all occaſions as it lay in their power.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:173010:92"/>
            <p> But why's the Bp. ſo loud and hiddenly ſmiting the <hi>Quakers,</hi> we think he might have been ſilent in ſuch a charge above many others, ſince no <hi>Quaker</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> was ſo high a <hi>Director</hi> (to give his own words) as a <hi>Parliament Man,</hi> which the Bp. was in thoſe times, which we do not reflect upon him for, yet he that was ſuch, he that writ the <hi>Specimen of Loyalty</hi> and ſo largely aſſerted the Right of that Goverment, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted; and he that publickly reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſilenced a Clergy Man in <hi>Cork</hi> for a Certain ſhortneſs in his Office, the better to expreſs his great Loyalty, might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born this undue as well as untrue charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi> We do not aggravate the matter, otherwiſe we could be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as to the two laſt, nor indeed had we mentioned any of them but that we were led to it by his hidden reflection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> 26. He <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Bp.) <hi>never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Quakers,</hi> &amp;c.—to which we anſwer, as we are plain where he injures us, ſo we will not be unjuſt where he deſerves praiſe; we do confeſs we never heard he did, and tho' perſecution be diſagreable to the very nature of Chriſtianity, yet the contrary is commendable in the Bp. ſince ſome, while in their power, have been greatly guilty of perſecution, and altho' this controverſie has
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:173010:93"/> happened with the Bp. yet we may juſtly ſay, 'twas neither deſired nor ſought for by us, and had the Bp. continued to be as eaſie with his <hi>Pen</hi> as he was in not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the <hi>Quakers</hi> otherways, there had been no occaſion for all this publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy: the Bp. tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 26. <hi>he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a certain perſon from publiſhing Memoirs of Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>Life, of his turning Quaker, and of his buſineſs at ſaint Omers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> So far as the Bp. really did ſo in tenderneſs to the good name of <hi>W. P.</hi> it is to be commended in him (tho' ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs were ever ſo untrue) However we tell the Bp. whatever his mind was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet the giving ſuch a ſlant of being at <hi>St. Omers</hi> don't now look very kind: We farther tell the Bp. that <hi>W. P.</hi> is no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to malitious lies and forgeries, both upon himſelf in particular as well as upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general; and as to the true reaſon of <hi>W. P's.</hi> turning <hi>Quaker,</hi> whatever Malice may frame or ſuggeſt, yet we think no conſiderate and Impartial Man can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly believe, he had any other motive or conſideration to his turning Quaker, but the good of his Soul, while the way to <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> (ſo called) is ſo very contrary to the greatneſs, Honour, and preferment with other ſuch like worldly conſiderations (which are moſt commonly the motives to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:173010:93"/> great Changes) and that at the ſame time <hi>W. P.</hi> turned Quaker, he turned his back upon all theſe things.</p>
            <p>Next as to the buſineſs of <hi>St. Omers:</hi> This Inſtance ſhews what ſort of Memoirs theſe were like to be. This Story is as old and thread bare as it is falſe, and if lying charges and ſtories were proofs <hi>W. P.</hi> was not only at <hi>St. Omers</hi> but had received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at <hi>Rome,</hi> and had dyed a <hi>Papiſt</hi> many years paſt: But why do not all his falſe Accuſers prove his being there, by aſſigning a credible witneſs or witneſſes, who ſaw him there, or ſome way or other demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate he was there? No that was never done, and indeed for a good reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it could not in truth be done. Now this blind ſtory, we confront by a publick Print, written by <hi>W. P.</hi> in anſwer to a friend of his, who importunately deſired him for ſatisfaction to the credulous, and ſuch who knew not <hi>W. P.</hi> that he would in a Publick maner anſwer that among other lying ſtories; the Letter is Dated<hi>—October,</hi> 1688. wherein <hi>W. P.</hi> makes return to thoſe lying Aſperſions, <hi>p.</hi> 11. and Solemnly declares that he was not only no <hi>Jeſuit</hi> or <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but that he never was at <hi>St. Omers in all his Life, nor did he ſo much as know, or ever correſpond with any one there.</hi> Here <hi>W. P.</hi> put it upon the teſt, his lying Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:173010:94"/> had then a fair opportunity (if they could) to prove him a Lyer, and in ſo doing would have had good ground to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him a <hi>Papiſt</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 26. and 27. The Bp. concludes his Book, firſt, telling of <hi>W. P's. vile Treatment,</hi> and calls his <hi>Defence an unhandſome piece;</hi> then proceeds with a Prayer <hi>that God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all to Mr.</hi> P. <hi>and his brethren, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon them a Spirit of true Faith, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace, of heavenly mindedneſs, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Mortification, and all the Graces they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to; and that their hearts may be one day found as void of Errour, Pride, Scorn, and peeviſh rancour, as Mr.</hi> P's. <hi>Book is full of the expreſſions of them all.</hi> Thus ends the Bp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to the <hi>vile Treatment</hi> and the Expreſſions of <hi>Errour, Pride, Scorn, peeviſh rancour,</hi> &amp;c. the Bp. tells us is in <hi>W. P's. unhandſom piece;</hi> we ſay they are hard words, and ſooner ſaid then proved, and the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may remember, the Bp. throughout his Reply has been readier at charges then proofs, moſt of which (we think) has in the end fallen upon himſelf inſtead of <hi>W. P.</hi> as we have ſhewn; and in this caſe we do deny what the Bp. hath aſſerted, and for <hi>Umpirage</hi> (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the matter) refer our ſelves to the Impartial Reader, who have been moſt guilty of theſe and ſuch like expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Defence,</hi> or the Bp. in his <hi>Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:173010:94"/>
            <p> Next as to the Bp's. <hi>Prayer.</hi> If the Bp. had been more ſparing to <hi>miſrepreſent, villifie,</hi> and <hi>abuſe W. P.</hi> and the <hi>Quakers;</hi> then he hath been, it might have come with leſs ſuſpition of its reality; but we think its next to impoſſible that any Man who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to <hi>abuſe</hi> and <hi>miſrepreſent</hi> another, can at the ſame time <hi>Pray truly</hi> and <hi>heartily</hi> for him: And as to thoſe Graces the Bp. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tho' on the one hand we will not boaſt of them, yet through the mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, ſome of us can in humility of Soul ſay, we have in meaſure witneſſed the work of <hi>Mortification</hi> in our Souls, through the Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude; We can in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity ſay we have not, according to the beſt of our underſtandings, either <hi>miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented</hi> the Bp. or <hi>wilfully overlookt</hi> his ſenſe, but ſo far as we underſtood the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his words, and where the force of his Arguments lay, we have as truly ſtated them, and thereupon anſwered with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs; and whether we have thus done by the Bp. and he hath done ſo by <hi>W. P.</hi> or not, is left to the Impartial Reader, and ſo we conclude this Rejoynder.</p>
